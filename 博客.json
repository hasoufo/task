        "正文": "Today we did a research launch of DALL•E 2, a new AI tool that can create and edit images from natural language instructions. Most importantly, we hope people love the tool and find it useful. For me, it’s the most delightful thing to play with we’ve created so far. I find it to be creativity-enhancing, helpful for many different situations, and fun in a way I haven’t felt from technology in a while.But I also think it’s noteworthy for a few reasons:1) This is another example of what I think is going to be a new computer interface trend: you say what you want in natural language or with contextual clues, and the computer does it. We offer this for code and now image generation; both of these will get a lot better. But the same trend will happen in new ways until eventually it works for complex tasks—we can imagine an “AI office worker” that takes requests in natural language like a human does.2) It sure does seem to “understand” concepts at many levels and how they relate to each other in sophisticated ways.3) Copilot is a tool that helps coders be more productive, but still is very far from being able to create a full program. DALL•E 2 is a tool that will help artists and illustrators be more creative, but it can also create a “complete work”. This may be an early example of the impact AI on labor markets. Although I firmly believe AI will create lots of new jobs, and make many existing jobs much better by doing the boring bits well, I think it’s important to be honest that it’s increasingly going to make some jobs not very relevant (like technology frequently does).4) It’s a reminder that predictions about AI are very difficult to make. A decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that AI would first impact physical labor, and then cognitive labor, and then maybe someday it could do creative work. It now looks like it’s going to go in the opposite order.5) It’s an example of a world in which good ideas are the limit for what we can do, not specific skills.6) Although the upsides are great, the model is powerful enough that it's easy to imagine the downsides.Hopefully this summer, we’ll do a product launch and people will be able to use it for all sorts of things. We wanted to start with a research launch to figure out how to minimize the downsides in collaboration with a larger group of researchers and artists, and to give people some time to adapt to the change—in general, we are believers in incremental deployment strategies.

Helion is by far the most promising approach to fusion I’ve seen.David and Chris are two of the most impressive founders and builders (in the sense of building fusion machines, in addition to building companies!) I have ever met, and they have done something remarkable. When I first invested in them back in 2014, I was struck by the thoughtfulness of their plans about the scientific approach, the system design, cost optimizations, and the fuel cycle.And now, with a tiny fraction of the money spent on other fusion efforts but the culture of a startup, they and their team have built a generator that produces electricity. Helion has a clear path to net electricity by 2024, and has a long-term goal of delivering electricity for 1 cent per kilowatt-hour. (!)If this all works as we hope, we may have a path out of the climate crisis. Even though there are a lot of emissions that don’t come from electrical generation, we’d be able to use abundant energy to capture carbon and other greenhouses gases.And if we have much cheaper energy than ever before, we can do things that are difficult to imagine today. The cost of energy is one of the fundamental inputs in the costs of so much else; dramatically cheaper energy will lead to dramatically better quality of life for many people."

        "正文": "A founder recently asked me how to stop caring what other people think. I didn’t have an answer, and after reflecting on it more, I think it's the wrong question.Almost everyone cares what someone thinks (though caring what everyone thinks is definitely a mistake), and it's probably important. Caring too much makes you a sheep. But you need to be at least a little in tune with others to do something useful for them.It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesn’t seem to get much attention.The most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldn’t value (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters). But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other people’s opinions on a very long time horizon—as long as the history books get it right, they take some pride in letting the newspapers get it wrong. You should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet. But there are lots of other ways–the key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness. You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved. [1] In the memorable words of Coco Chanel, “I don’t care what you think about me. I don’t think about you at all.”"

In general, people seem to assume that: 1) although there was some degree of mystery or luck about how YC got going, it can’t be that hard, and 2) if you can get it off the ground, the network effects are self-sustaining.More YC-like things are good for the world; I generally try to be helpful. But almost none of them work. People are right about the self-sustaining part, but they can’t figure out how to get something going.The entire secret to YC getting going was PG and Jessica—there was no other magic trick. A few times a year, I end up in a conversation at a party where someone tells a story about how much PG changed their life—people speak with more gratitude than they do towards pretty much anyone else. Then everyone else agrees, YC founders and otherwise (non-YC founders might talk about an impactful essay or getting hired at a YC company). Jessica still sadly doesn’t get nearly the same degree of public credit, but the people who were around the early days of YC know the real story.What did they do? They took bets on unknown people and believed in them more than anyone had before. They set strong norms and fought back hard against bad behavior towards YC founders. They trusted their own convictions, were willing to do things their way, and were willing to be disliked by the existing power structures. They focused on the most important things, they worked hard, and they spent a huge amount of time 1:1 with people. They understood the value of community and long-term orientation. When YC was very small, it felt like a family.Perhaps most importantly, they built an ecosystem (thanks to Joe Gebbia for pointing this out). This is easy to talk about but hard to do, because it requires not being greedy. YC has left a lot of money on the table; other people have made more money from the ecosystem than YC has itself. This has cemented YC’s place—the benefits to the partners, alumni, current batch founders, Hacker News readers, Demo Day investors, and everyone else around YC is a huge part of what makes it work.I am not sure if any of this is particularly useful advice—none of it sounds that hard, and yet in the 15 years since, it hasn’t been close to replicated.But it seems worth trying. I am pretty sure no one has had a bigger total impact on the careers of people in the startup industry over that time period than the two of them."

(This from John Schulman is worth reading: http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).They have a laser focus on the next step in front of them combined with long-term vision. Most people only have one or the other.They are extremely persistent and willing to work hard. As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this, and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless you’d be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves).They have a bias towards action and trying things, and they’re clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn’t (importantly, this goes both ways—I’m amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it). They are creative idea-generators—a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.They really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they don’t think make sense. They are definitely not lemmings.Their motivations are often more complex than they seem—specifically, they are frequently very driven by genuine curiosity."

Dramatically improving clinical trials, which are usually time-consuming and cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, is one of the highest-leverage ways to get out of it faster.  The goal of this project, in collaboration with TrialSpark and Dr. Mark Fishman, is to offer much better clinical trial support to COVID-19 projects than anything that currently exists.Project Covalence’s platform, powered by TrialSpark, is uniquely optimized to support COVID-19 trials, which are ideally run in community settings or at the patient’s home to reduce the burden placed on hospitals and health systems. Project Covalence is well-positioned to tackle the operational and logistical challenges involved in launching such trials, and supports trial execution, 21 CFR Part 11 compliant remote data collection, telemedicine, biostatistics, sample kits for at-home specimen collection, and protocol writing. Researchers across academia and industry can leverage this shared infrastructure to rapidly launch their clinical trials. To facilitate coordination between studies, we will also be creating master protocols for platform studies to enable shared control arms and adaptive trial designs.If you’re interested in getting involved or have a trial that needs support, please get in touch at ProjectCovalence@trialspark.com or visit www.projectcovalence.com."

        "正文": "The most common question prospective startup founders ask is how to get ideas for startups. The second most common question is if you have any ideas for their startup.But giving founders an idea almost always doesn’t work. Having ideas is among the most important qualities for a startup founder to have—you will need to generate lots of new ideas in the course of running a startup.YC once tried an experiment of funding seemingly good founders with no ideas. I think every company in this no-idea track failed. It turns out that good founders have lots of ideas about everything, so if you want to be a founder and can’t get an idea for a company, you should probably work on getting good at idea generation first.How do you do that?It’s important to be in the right kind of environment, and around the right kind of people. You want to be around people who have a good feel for the future, will entertain improbable plans, are optimistic, are smart in a creative way, and have a very high idea flux. These sorts of people tend to think without the constraints most people have, not have a lot of filters, and not care too much what other people think. The best ideas are fragile; most people don’t even start talking about them at all because they sound silly. Perhaps most of all, you want to be around people who don’t make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea, and who certainly never feel stupid for doing so themselves.Stay away from people who are world-weary and belittle your ambitions. Unfortunately, this is most of the world. But they hold on to the past, and you want to live in the future.You want to be able to project yourself 20 years into the future, and then think backwards from there. Trust yourself—20 years is a long time; it’s ok if your ideas about it seem pretty radical. Another way to do this is to think about the most important tectonic shifts happening right now. How is the world changing in fundamental ways? Can you identify a leading edge of change and an opportunity that it unlocks? The mobile phone explosion from 2008-2012 is the most recent significant example of this—we are overdue for another!In such a tectonic shift, the world changes so fast that the big incumbents usually get beaten by fast-moving and focused startups. (By the way, it’s useful to get good at differentiating between real trends and fake trends. A key differentiator is if the new platform is used a lot by a small number of people, or used a little by a lot of people.)Any time you can think of something that is possible this year and wasn’t possible last year, you should pay attention. You may have the seed of a great startup idea. This is especially true if next year will be too late.When you can say “I am sure this is going to happen, I’m just not sure if we’ll be the ones to do it”, that’s a good sign. Uber was like this for me—after the first time I used it, it was clear we weren’t going to be calling cabs for that much longer, but I wasn’t sure that Uber was going to win the space.A good question to ask yourself early in the process of thinking about an idea is “could this be huge if it worked?” There are many good ideas in the world, but few of them have the inherent advantages that can make a startup massively successful. Most businesses don’t generate a valuable accumulating advantage as they scale. Think early about why an idea might have that property. It’s obvious for Facebook or Airbnb, but it often exists in more subtle ways.It’s also important to think about what you’re well-suited for. This is hard to do with pure introspection; ideally you can ask a mentor or some people you’ve worked with what you’re particularly good at. I’ve come to believe that founder/company fit is as important as product/market fit.Finally, a good test for an idea is if you can articulate why most people think it’s a bad idea, but you understand what makes it good.This is from my notes for a talk I gave at a YC event in China in 2018. Thanks to Eric Migicovsky for encouraging me to post it!I wrote it when I thought mostly about startups; now I think mostly about AI development. I am struck by how much of it applies, particularly paragraphs 5-9."

A good hard startup is one that will be valuable if it works (not all hard problems are worth solving!).I remember when Instagram started to get really popular—it felt like you couldn’t go a day without hearing about another photo sharing startup.  That year, probably over 1,000 photo sharing startups were funded, while there were fewer than ten nuclear fusion startups in existence.Easy startups are easy to start but hard to make successful.  The most precious commodity in the startup ecosystem right now is talented people, and for the most part talented people want to work on something they find meaningful.A startup eventually has to get a lot of people to join its quest.  It’s usually reasonably easy to get the first five or ten people to join—you can offer large equity grants and areas of responsibility.  But eventually, what you have to recruit with are the mission of the company, the likelihood of massive success, and the quality of the people there. [1]Few recruiting messages are as powerful (when true) as “the world needs this, it won’t happen any time soon if we don’t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don’t join.”There is a derivative of the Peter Principle at play here—your startup will rise to the level where it can no longer attract enough talented people.  (This sometimes holds true for careers too—the limiting factor for many careers eventually becomes how many talented people you know and can get to work with you.)An easy startup is a headwind; a hard startup is a tailwind.  If people care about your success because you seem committed to doing something significant, it’s a background force helping you with hiring, advice, partnerships, fundraising, etc.Part of the magic of Silicon Valley is that people default to taking you seriously if you’re willing to be serious—they’ve learned it’s a very expensive mistake, in aggregate, not to.  If you want to start a company working on a better way to build homes, gene editing, artificial general intelligence, a new education system, or carbon sequestration, you may actually be able to get it funded, even if you don’t have a degree or much experience. Let yourself become more ambitious—figure out the most interesting version of where what you’re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step.  You don’t want step one to be incorporating the company and step two to be going to Mars.Be willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you’re doing.  Most people aren’t, which is part of the reason they pick “easy” startups.  In a world of compounding advantages where most people are operating on a 3 year timeframe and you’re operating on a 10 year timeframe, you’ll have a very large edge. Thanks to Luke Miles for reviewing drafts of this.[1] Another solution to this problem is to think about startups that can become quite successful with less than ten people.  As compensation packages from the giant tech companies continue to increase, I suspect this will become a trend."

You can often help the companies you invest in become bigger than they otherwise would have been, but the sad reality is that your best investments will do quite well without you.AccessGetting access to investment opportunities is the easiest of the three categories: you can just work hard.  It’s surprising that most investors don’t work hard, but it’s true, and a bug that you can exploit.Putting a lot of energy into networking actually works, as long as you aren’t just trying to touch base when people can find some time away from their crazy calendars to grab coffee.  If you actually figure out how to help other investors you respect, and to really help good founders, then good investment opportunities will come your way.If you’re starting out as a full-time investor, make it your full-time job to figure out how to help people that will become your future investment-sourcing network.  Instead of just asking your contacts to tell you about investment opportunities, ask them if you can spend a day per week helping their best company.  In general, early-stage investors can help a lot with closing candidates, future fundraising, customer introductions, and generic advice.A brand is the other way to get access.  There are a lot of ways to build one, but by the same principle of working hard, a good example is to write long-form content (hard, few people do a good job at it) instead of tweeting (easy, everyone does a pretty good job at it). DecisionsGreat founders are the key to great startups.  One way to do really well as a startup investor is to get good at predicting who is going to be great before they are—the market rewards finding great but inexperienced people.  You can also do well by investing in people who are already proven, but the price of the shares you buy will reflect that.So how do you identify future greatness?It’s easiest if you get to meet people in person, several times.  If you meet someone three times in three months, and notice detectable improvement each time, pay attention to that.  The rate of improvement is often more important than the current absolute ability (in particular, younger founders can sometimes improve extremely quickly).The main question I ask myself when I meet a founder is if I’d work for that person.  The second question I ask myself is if I can imagine them taking over their industry.I look for founders who are scrappy and formidable at the same time (a rarer combination than it sounds); mission-oriented, obsessed with their companies, relentless, and determined; extremely smart (necessary but certainly not sufficient); decisive, fast-moving, and willful; courageous, high-conviction, and willing to be misunderstood; strong communicators and infectious evangelists; and capable of becoming tough and ambitious. Some of these characteristics seem to be easier to change than others; for example, I have noticed that people can become much tougher and more ambitious rapidly, but people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to change.  Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails.Also, it sounds obvious, but the successful founders I’ve funded believe they are eventually certain to be successful.In addition to learning to predict who will become great founders, you have to be at least okay at predicting what markets will be good.Startups are likely to happen in many more industries—startups can win wherever costs can be low and cycle time can be fast.  Startups do particularly well in industries with rapid technological change, because their fundamental advantages over large competitors are speed and focus.  A higher rate of change gives startups more opportunities to be right and the large competitor more opportunities to stumble.Like the founder, and like a company, what you should care about is the growth rate and eventual size of a market (I don’t know why most investors are so obsessed with the current size of a market instead of how big they think it will be in ten years, but it’s an opportunity for you).The best companies tend to have the courage to lead the market by a couple of years, but they know the secret for telling the difference between a real trend and a fake trend.  For a real trend, even if there aren’t many users, they use the new platform a lot and love it.  For example, although the iPhone was derided for not having many users in its first year or two, most people who had an iPhone raved about it in a way that they never did about previous smartphones.The very best companies tend to ride the wave of a new, important, and rapidly growing platform.The spectral signatures of the best companies I’ve invested in are remarkably similar.  They usually have most of the following characteristics: compelling founders, a mission that attracts talented people into the startup’s orbit, a product so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, a rapidly growing market, a network effect and low marginal costs, the ability to grow fast, and a product that is either fundamentally new or 10x better than existing options.You should try to limit yourself to opportunities that could be $10 billion companies if they work (which means they have, at least, a fast-growing market and some sort of pricing power).  The power law is that powerful.  This is easy to say and hard to do, and I’ve been guilty of violating the principle many times.  But the data are clear—the failures don’t matter much, the small successes don’t matter much, and the giant returns are where everything happens.The central learning of my career so far has been that you can and should scale up things that are working.  The power of scale, and the emergent behavior that sometimes comes from it, is tremendous.  I think about the potential energy of future scale for every investment I make.  Most people seem terrible at this, so it’s another bug you can exploit.  Although good ideas are understandably seductive, for early-stage investing they are mostly valuable as a way to identify good founders.  However, sometimes bad founders have good ideas too, and investing in them is the chronic investing mistake that has been hardest for me to correct.  (My second biggest chronic mistake has been chasing investments primarily because other investors like them.)Close rateThe better the investment opportunity is (i.e., expected value relative to valuation), the harder it usually is to get the company to choose you as an investor.Traditional sales tactics works pretty well here.  Spend a lot of time with the founder, explain what you’re willing to do to help them, ask founders you’ve worked with in the past to call them, etc. A reputation for being above-and-beyond helpful and accessible is worth a lot here, and rare among all but the best investors.  A reputation for being founder-friendly helps too.  What helps most of all is other founders you’ve previously invested in saying “that person was my best investor by far”.In addition to helping get access to investment opportunities, a strong brand also helps close them.  It’s a nice tailwind if you can get yourself to the place where simply taking your money helps a company get taken more seriously.Decisiveness also helps—everyone wants to be wanted, and most investors wait for someone else to act first.  If you decide quickly, and especially if you decide before others do, founders tend to appreciate that.  The two most recent significant investments I made were 1) telling people I’d previously backed and had huge conviction in that I would do their Series A before they finished telling me what their idea was, and 2) offering to do the seed round of founders I’d never met before at the end of a one hour meeting.  I don’t recommend doing that very often, but when your conviction is strong, let it show.   The best way to have a poor close rate is to not treat founders like peers.  If you’re picking well, you should be investing in founders that you think of as your peers at least.  Founders have a sixth sense for who is going to treat them like a peer and who is going to treat them like a boss.  And if they’re good, they know you’re failing an intelligence test if you act like their boss.Help themThe most important way to help founders is to get them to be more ambitious—to think bigger and to have more self-belief.  Help them set ambitious but achievable goals.  Momentum is important and self-reinforcing—most people set goals that they expect to be just out of reach, which is usually demotivating.  It’s better to continuously set goals that you can just barely hit.The second most important thing to do is to give them specific, tactical advice (instead of general strategy) about how to achieve their goals.  Good tactical advice is something like “it seems like you’ve figured out yourself how to do sales for this company, so here is where to look and what to look for in your first sales hire, and here is the sales tool you should use”.There are a lot of specific things you can do to help—make introductions, help them hire, help them find other investors, help them find an office, etc.—but generally you should wait to do these until asked. A big exception is that you should proactively let them know when you have very high conviction that they’re about to make a big mistake, especially once things are working and they aren’t setting themselves up to scale.In theory, another big exception is actually helping founders come up with good new ideas.  The first investor I ever watched in action was PG and so I assumed this was something all investors were fantastic at.  But it turns out he is a sui generis idea generator, and even most great investors are usually still bad at telling founders what to work on.  It’s worth trying to be self-aware.Finally, I’ve found that most of the time when founders call asking for vague help, what they are really asking for is emotional support from a friend.  Invite them over to your house, make them tea or pour them a drink, and start listening to their struggles.Thanks to Jack Altman, Max Altman, and Luke Miles for reviewing drafts of this."

        "正文": "I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter. Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.1. Compound yourselfCompounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation. A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them. You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly. You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people. It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote. Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.  I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do. Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.2. Have almost too much self-belief Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more. If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created. I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.” Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.   Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition. Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion. This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.3. Learn to think independently Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own. Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world. “I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky. One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.4. Get good at “sales”Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe. All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability. Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language. The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful. Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable.  My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way. 5. Make it easy to take risks Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more. It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction. Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.   But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.6. FocusFocus is a force multiplier on work. Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter. Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.7. Work hardYou can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.  Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. And it’s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.   It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world—the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark. You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with. I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success. One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.8. Be boldI believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters. If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on. If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it. Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.9. Be willfulA big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential. Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.  Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way. Airbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn’t recommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-ring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, battle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to survive long enough for luck to go their way. To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.10. Be hard to compete withMost people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true. But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it. Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.11. Build a networkGreat work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish. An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago. One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out. Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are. A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment. I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things. A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!) Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions. 12. You get rich by owning thingsThe biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. Though there are some exceptions—entertainers for example —almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary. You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly. The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale. 13. Be internally drivenMost people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones. First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway. Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term. Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little—you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap. The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance. This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.  Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model. Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.[1] A comment response I wrote on HN:One of the biggest reasons I'm excited about basic income is the amount of human potential it will unleash by freeing more people to take risks.Until then, if you aren't born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can take big swings. If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult :(\nIt is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I've witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it's possible.I am deeply aware of the fact that I personally would not be where I am if I weren't born incredibly lucky.\nThanks to Brian Armstrong, Greg Brockman, Dalton Caldwell, Diane von Furstenberg, Maddie Hall, Drew Houston, Vinod Khosla, Jessica Livingston, Jon Levy, Luke Miles (6 drafts!), Michael Moritz, Ali Rowghani, Michael Seibel, Peter Thiel, Tracy Young and Shivon Zilis for reviewing drafts of this, and thanks especially to Lachy Groom for help writing it.\n \n\n\n"

        "正文": "I am pretty sure cryptocurrency is here to stay in some form (at least as a store of value, which is the only use case we have seen work at scale so far).  There was possibly a time when governments could have totally stopped it, but it feels like that’s in the rearview mirror. However, I think it’s very possible that the dominant cryptocurrency hasn’t been created yet (Google was years late to the search engine party, and Facebook came long after most people assumed the social network wars were won).  And from the perspective of a nation, there are real problems with current systems, especially around pseudo-anonymity, ability to function as an actual currency, and taxability. Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner–let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency–and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency.I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency. The US government could decide to treat USDC as a second legal currency, which would be hugely powerful.  (I think the US doing this would be significantly more impactful than the smaller governments thinking about it now.) Ideally the initial coins would be evenly distributed to US citizens and taxpayers—something like everyone with a social security number gets two coins, one that is immediately sellable and one that you have to keep for 10 years. USDC could require that certain transaction can only happen with wallets with known owners.  It could even build a tax system into the protocol. A tricky part of this would be how to balance letting the network have control over itself and letting the government have some special degree of input on ‘monetary policy’.  It’s certainly ok for the government to have some, but I think the network needs to be mostly in charge (e.g., the government couldn’t be allowed to arbitrarily inflate the currency when it wanted to).The current practices seem to be for governments to mostly ignore cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to mostly ignore government, which seems to me to be unsustainable in both directions.  But I believe there exists a middle ground where the government can get a lot of what it wants, and cryptocurrency users can get a lot of what they want too.The government can likely create a lot of de novo wealth for its citizens in the process."

If you get 10%\nmore done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded\ndifference is massive. \n\nWhat you work on\n\nIt doesn’t\nmatter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the\nmost important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!  Independent thought is hard but it’s\nsomething you can get better at with practice.\n\nThe most\nimpressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in\nthe general population.  If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever\nyou last spoke with, that’s bad.  You\nwill of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with\nyour convictions.  It will let you be\ncourageous when you’re right about something important that most people don’t\nsee.\n\nI make sure to\nleave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best\nways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people,\nand spending time in nature.\n\nI’ve learned\nthat I can’t be very productive working on things I don’t care about or don’t\nlike.  So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do\nthem (by delegating, avoiding, or something else).  Stuff that you don’t\nlike is a painful drag on morale and momentum.\n\nBy the way,\nhere is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also\nmost productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what you’d want other\npeople to do for you—try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what,\nand delegate that way.  \n\nIf you find\nyourself not liking what you’re doing for a long period of time, seriously\nconsider a major job change.  Short-term burnout happens, but if it isn’t\nresolved with some time off, maybe it’s time to do something you’re more\ninterested in. \n\nI’ve been very\nfortunate to find work I like so much I’d do it for free, which makes it easy\nto be really productive.\n\nIt’s important\nto learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better\nquickly.  This feels like an unlikely miracle the first few times it\nhappens, but eventually you learn to trust that you can do it.\n\nDoing great\nwork usually requires colleagues of some sort.  Try to be around smart,\nproductive, happy, and positive people that don’t belittle your ambitions.  I love being around people who push me and\ninspire me to be better.  To the degree\nyou able to, avoid the opposite kind of people—the cost of letting them take up\nyour mental cycles is horrific. \n\nYou have to\nboth pick the right problem and do the work.  There aren’t many\nshortcuts.  If you’re going to do\nsomething really important, you are very likely going to work both smart and\nhard.  The biggest prizes are heavily competed for.  This isn’t true in every field (there are\ngreat mathematicians who never spend that many hours a week working) but it is\nin most.\n\n﻿Prioritization\n\nMy system has\nthree key pillars: “Make sure to get the important shit done”, “Don’t waste\ntime on stupid shit”, and “make a lot of lists”.\n\nI highly\nrecommend using lists.  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each\nyear, each month, and each day.  Lists are very focusing, and they help me\nwith multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head.  If I’m not in the mood for some particular\ntask, I can always find something else I’m excited to do.\n\nI prefer lists\nwritten down on paper.  It’s easy to add\nand remove tasks.  I can access them\nduring meetings without feeling rude.  I\nre-transcribe lists frequently, which forces me to think about everything on the\nlist and gives me an opportunity to add and remove items.\n\nI don’t bother\nwith categorization or trying to size tasks or anything like that (the most I\ndo is put a star next to really important items).  \n\nI try to\nprioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the\nbetter I feel, and then the more I get done. \nI like to start and end each day with something I can really make\nprogress on.\n\nI am\nrelentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I\nreally want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens. \n\nI try to be\nruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the\nquickest way possible.  I probably take this too far—for example, I am\nalmost sure I am terse to the point of rudeness when replying to emails.\n\nI generally\ntry to avoid meetings and conferences as I find the time cost to be huge—I get\nthe most value out of time in my office.  However, it is critical that you\nkeep enough space in your schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure\nto new people and ideas.  Having an open network is valuable; though\nprobably 90% of the random meetings I take are a waste of time, the other 10%\nreally make up for it.I find most meetings are best scheduled for 15-20 minutes, or 2 hours.  The default of 1 hour is usually wrong, and leads to a lot of wasted time.\n\nI have\ndifferent times of day I try to use for different kinds of work.  The\nfirst few hours of the morning are definitely my most productive time of the\nday, so I don’t let anyone schedule anything then.  I try to do meetings\nin the afternoon.  I take a break, or\nswitch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade. \n\nI don’t think\nmost people value their time enough—I am surprised by the number of people I\nknow who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something\nthey don’t want to do to save $20.\n\nAlso, don’t\nfall into the trap of productivity porn—chasing productivity for its own sake\nisn’t helpful.  Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly\noptimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they’re working on the\nright problems.  It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze\nout every second if you’re working on the wrong thing.\n\nThe right goal\nis to allocate your year optimally, not your day.\n\nPhysical factors\n\nVery likely\nwhat is optimal for me won’t be optimal for you.  You’ll have to\nexperiment to find out what works best for your body.  It’s definitely worth doing—it helps in all\naspects of life, and you’ll feel a lot better and happier overall.\n\nIt probably\ntook a little bit of my time every week for a few years to arrive at what works\nbest for me, but my sense is if I do a good job at all the below I’m at least\n1.5x more productive than if not.\n\nSleep seems to\nbe the most important physical factor in productivity for me.  Some sort\nof sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful.  I’ve found the only\nthing I’m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I\nreally like the Emfit QS+Active.\n\nI like a cold,\ndark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on\na great mattress for years, which was stupid—it makes a huge difference to my\nsleep quality.  I love this one).  Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep\nhelps.  Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though\nI’m not willing to do that all the time.\n\nI use a Chili\nPad to be cold while I sleep if I can’t get the room cold enough, which is\ngreat but loud (I set it up to have the cooler unit outside my room).\n\nWhen traveling,\nI use an eye mask and ear plugs.\n\nThis is likely\nto be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a\nnormal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep.  I am\na bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel.  It likely has tradeoffs,\nbut so does not sleeping well.  If you\ncan already sleep well, I wouldn’t recommend this.\n\nI use a full\nspectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on\nemail.  It’s great—if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I’d\ntry.  It’s a ridiculous gain for me.\n I like this one, and it’s easy to travel with.\n\nExercise is\nprobably the second most important physical factor.  I tried a number of\ndifferent exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best\nwas lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval\ntraining occasionally.  In addition to productivity gains, this is also\nthe exercise program that makes me feel the best overall.  \n\nThe third area\nis nutrition.  I very rarely eat breakfast, so I get about 15 hours of\nfasting most days (except an espresso when I wake up).  I know this is contrary\nto most advice, and I suspect it’s not optimal for most people, but it\ndefinitely works well for me.\n\nEating lots of\nsugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to\navoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up\ninflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I don’t have much willpower when it comes to\nsweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house.\n\nI have one big shot of espresso immediately when I wake up and one after lunch.  I assume this is\nabout 200mg total of caffeine per day.  I\ntried a few other configurations; this was the one that worked by far the best.\n I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if\nI’m super tired and really need to get something done.\n\nI’m\nvegetarian and have been since I was a kid, and I supplement methyl B-12, Omega-3, Iron, and Vitamin D-3.  I\ngot to this list with a year or so of quarterly blood tests; it’s worked for me\never since (I re-test maybe every year and a half or so).  There are many\ndoctors who will happily work with you on a super comprehensive blood test (and\nservices like WellnessFX).  I also go out\nof my way to drink a lot of protein shakes, which I hate and I wouldn’t do if I\nweren’t vegetarian.\n\n﻿Other stuff\n\nHere’s what I\nlike in a workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing that I won’t be interrupted\nif I don’t want to be, long blocks of time, and being comfortable and relaxed\n(I’ve got a beautiful desk with a couple of 4k monitors on it in my office, but\nI spend almost all my time on my couch with my laptop).\n\nI wrote custom\nsoftware for the annoying things I have to do frequently, which is great.\n I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard\nshortcuts that help with my workflow.\n\nLike most\npeople, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no\nmotivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with\nnutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient\ntimes.  I have not figured out what to do\nabout it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it\nalways does.  And I generally try to\navoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice\nwhether you care about productivity or not.\n\nIn general, I\nthink it’s good to overcommit a little bit.  I find that I generally get\ndone what I take on, and if I have a little bit too much to do it makes me more\nefficient at everything, which is a way to train to avoid distractions (a great\nhabit to build!).  However, overcommitting a lot is disastrous.\n\nDon’t neglect\nyour family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid\ntradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less\nhappy).  Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head\neither.\n\nFinally, to\nrepeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything\nat all.  Think more about what to work on."

        "正文": "I made a point in this post inelegantly in a way that was\neasy to misunderstand, so I’d like to clarify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn’t mean that we need to tolerate brilliant homophobic\njerks in the lab so that we can have scientific progress. \nAlthough there are famous counterexamples, most of the best scientists\nI’ve met are unusually nice, open-minded people.  Generally I expect that labs that don’t\ntolerate jerks will produce more impressive results than the ones that do, and choosing not to employ jerks is a good idea—jerks usually\nreduce the net output of organizations.\n\nWhat I meant is simply that we need, as a society, to\ntolerate controversial ideas.  The\nbiggest new scientific ideas, and the most important changes to society, both start\nas extremely unpopular ideas.\n\nIt was literally heretical, not so long ago, to say that it\nwas ok to be gay—the Bible has a different viewpoint.  In a society where we don’t allow challenges\nto the orthodoxy, gay rights would not have happened.\n\nWe need to allow free speech because sometimes society is\nwrong—we needed people to be able to say “gay people are ok” at a time when\n“gay people are evil” was the consensus opinion.\n\nIt’s probably impossible to design a simple set of rules\nthat will always allow the right speech and not the wrong speech (although I am\nsure that in this particular case, it is wrong that gay people in some places\nstill fear for their safety.) \n\nSo we agree as a society that people are allowed to say\ncontroversial things, and that free speech goes both ways.  Much of the time people use that privilege to\nbe jerks, and we can, should, and do point out why their bigotry is bad.  Sometimes they use it to say that people\ndeserve more rights, or that the solar system works in a different way from what the church says—and sometimes we collectively listen. \n\nOver time, this system produces a more and more just world, which says something really good about people as a whole.\n\nI wish we could figure out a way to just never allow hate,\ndiscrimination, and bigotry and always allow debate on controversial but\nimportant ideas.  If that were possible,\nI’d support it.  The distinction is\nusually clear, but the exceptions are sometimes critically important.  Figuring out exactly where to draw the line is really hard.\n\nGenerations before us believed a lot of things we now\nbelieve (correctly, in my opinion) to be unethical or wrong.  Future generations will think a lot of things\nwe believe today are unethical or wrong. \n\nFor example, today it is pretty unpopular to say “anyone who\neats meat is unethical”.  But this is\neasily a stance I could imagine being commonplace in 50 years, because of\nevolving views on animal rights, impact on the planet, and availability of\nlab-grown replacements.  Perhaps even the\narrival of AI makes us think differently about being ok eating other beings\njust because they’re much less smart/emotionally sophisticated than we are.\n\nThe last time I tried to discuss this with\nsomeone, he said something like: “Banning eating meat would be infringing on my\nrights, this is not up for discussion.” \n\nI expect the fact that we let people live in\npoverty is also something that future generations will consider an absolute moral failing.  I could go on with a long\nlist of other ideas, and I’m sure I can’t even think of some of the most\nimportant ones.\n\nThe point I most wanted to make is that is that it’s\ndangerous to just ban discussion of topics we find offensive, like what\nhappened yesterday. "

        "正文": "Earlier\nthis year, I noticed something in China that really surprised me.  I\nrealized I felt more comfortable discussing controversial ideas in Beijing than\nin San Francisco.  I didn’t feel completely comfortable—this was China,\nafter all—just more comfortable than at home.\n\nThat showed me just how bad things have become, and how much things\nhave changed since I first got started here in 2005.\n\nIt\nseems easier to accidentally speak heresies in San Francisco every year.  Debating a controversial idea, even if you\n95% agree with the consensus side, seems ill-advised.\n\nThis will be very bad for startups in the Bay Area.\n\nRestricting\nspeech leads to restricting ideas and therefore restricted innovation—the most\nsuccessful societies have generally been the most open ones.  Usually mainstream ideas are right and\nheterodox ideas are wrong, but the true and unpopular ideas are what drive the\nworld forward.  Also, smart people tend\nto have an allergic reaction to the restriction of ideas, and I’m now seeing\nmany of the smartest people I know move elsewhere.\n\nIt\nis bad for all of us when people can’t say that the world is a sphere, that\nevolution is real, or that the sun is at the center of the solar system.\n\nMore\nrecently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for\nintelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension\nleave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so\ntoxic.  “If people live a lot longer it\nwill be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be\nreally unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year.\n\nTo\nget the really good ideas, we need to tolerate really bad and wacky ideas too.\n In addition to the work Newton is best known for, he also studied alchemy\n(the British authorities banned work on this because they feared the\ndevaluation of gold) and considered himself to be someone specially chosen by\nthe almighty for the task of decoding Biblical scripture.  \n\nYou\ncan’t tell which seemingly wacky ideas are going to turn out to be right, and\nnearly all ideas that turn out to be great breakthroughs start out sounding\nlike terrible ideas.  So if you want a culture that innovates, you can’t\nhave a culture where you allow the concept of heresy—if you allow the concept\nat all, it tends to spread.  When we move\nfrom strenuous debate about ideas to casting the people behind the ideas as\nheretics, we gradually stop debate on all controversial ideas.\n\nThis\nis uncomfortable, but it’s possible we have to allow people to say disparaging\nthings about gay people if we want them to be able to say novel things about\nphysics. [1] Of course we can and should say that ideas are mistaken, but we\ncan’t just call the person a heretic.  We\nneed to debate the actual idea. \n\nPolitical\ncorrectness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to\nmake accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being\nused as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express\nat all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be\nmisinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage.\n\nI\ndon’t know who Satoshi is, but I’m skeptical that he, she, or they would have\nbeen able to come up with the idea for bitcoin immersed in the current culture of\nSan Francisco—it would have seemed too crazy and too dangerous, with too many\nways to go wrong.  If SpaceX started in San Francisco in 2017, I assume\nthey would have been attacked for focusing on problems of the 1%, or for doing\nsomething the government had already decided was too hard.  I can picture\nGalileo looking up at the sky and whispering “E pur si muove” here today.\nFollowup: A Clarification\n\n[1]\nI am less worried that letting some people on the internet say things like “gay\npeople are evil” is going to convince reasonable people that such a\nstatement is true than I fear losing the opposite—we needed people to be free to say \"gay people are ok\" to make the progress we've made, even though it was not a generally acceptable thought several decades ago.\n\nIn\nfact, the only ideas I’m afraid of letting people say are the ones that I think\nmay be true and that I don’t like.  But I accept that censorship is not\ngoing to make the world be the way I wish it were."

        "正文": "A popular topic in Silicon Valley is talking about what year humans and machines will merge (or, if not, what year humans will get surpassed by rapidly improving AI or a genetically enhanced species). Most guesses seem to be between 2025 and 2075.People used to call this the singularity; now it feels uncomfortable and real enough that many seem to avoid naming it at all.Perhaps another reason people stopped using the word “singularity” is that it implies a single moment in time, and it now looks like the merge is going to be a gradual process. And gradual processes are hard to notice.I believe the merge has already started, and we are a few years in. Our phones control us and tell us what to do when; social media feeds determine how we feel; search engines decide what we think.The algorithms that make all this happen are no longer understood by any one person. They optimize for what their creators tell them to optimize for, but in ways that no human could figure out — they are what today seems like sophisticated AI, and tomorrow will seem like child’s play. And they’re extremely effective — at least speaking for myself, I have a very hard time resisting what the algorithms want me to do. Until I made a real effort to combat it, I found myself getting extremely addicted to the internet. [1]We are already in the phase of co-evolution — the AIs affect, effect, and infect us, and then we improve the AI. We build more computing power and run the AI on it, and it figures out how to build even better chips.This probably cannot be stopped. As we have learned, scientific advancement eventually happens if the laws of physics do not prevent it.More important than that, unless we destroy ourselves first, superhuman AI is going to happen, genetic enhancement is going to happen, and brain-machine interfaces are going to happen. It is a failure of human imagination and human arrogance to assume that we will never build things smarter than ourselves.Our self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing.The merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it—in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond—they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.It’s probably going to happen sooner than most people think. Hardware is improving at an exponential rate—the most surprising thing I’ve learned working on OpenAI is just how correlated increasing computing power and AI breakthroughs are—and the number of smart people working on AI is increasing exponentially as well. Double exponential functions get away from you fast.It would be good for the entire world to start taking this a lot more seriously now. Worldwide coordination doesn’t happen quickly, and we need it for this.[1] I believe attention hacking is going to be the sugar epidemic of this generation. I can feel the changes in my own life — I can still wistfully remember when I had an attention span. My friends’ young children don’t even know that’s something they should miss. I am angry and unhappy more often, but I channel it into productive change less often, instead chasing the dual dopamine hits of likes and outrage.(Cross-posted from https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/merge-now-430c6d89d1fe to here for consistency; thanks to Medium for inviting me to write this!)"

The content I see from Quora constantly gets more personalized for me.I also believe they have some of the highest-quality user-generated content on the internet, and a real chance at being one of the few places that contain all human knowledge. The engineering challenges between here and there are great, but if there’s a team and product to bet on, this is one we're backing with confidence.Adam is one of the few names that people consistently mention when discussing the smartest CEOs in Silicon Valley. And he has a very long-term focus, which has become a rare commodity in tech companies these days. My relationship with Quora goes back to May 2014 when the company participated in YC.  Funding an already successful company was an unusual experiment for us.  At that point we didn't have any specific thoughts on how YC might invest in graduates from our program and help them scale.  In a way, Quora was the inspiration for deciding we needed to figure out how to do that, and we launched YC Continuity in October 2015.As an early admirer of Quora and returning investor, I’m thrilled to see the progress they've made and excited to be part of what they do next."

[1] Doing this allows the government to ensure a level playing field, impose privacy regulations, and subsidize access for people who can't afford it.But this idea is under attack, and I'm surprised the tech community isn't speaking out more forcefully.  Although many leading tech companies are now the incumbents, I hope we'll all remember that openness helped them achieve their great success.  It could be disastrous for future startups if this were to change--openness is what made the recent wave of innovation happen.We need to make our voices heard.  We won this fight once before, and we can win it again.  I really hope an activist or tech leader will step up and organize this fight (and I'm happy to help!).  It's important for our future.[1] There's an argument that Internet Service Providers should be able to charge a metered rate based on usage.  I'm not sure whether I agree with this, but in principle it seems ok.  That's how we pay for public utilities. What's clearly not OK is taking it further--charging different services different rates based on their relationships with ISPs.  You wouldn't accept your electric company charging you different rates depending on the manufacturer of each of your appliances.\nEmailed comment from Alan Kay:\nYes -- in fact, the original notion about all this was to be in the same spirit as the 1936 Electrical and Telephone Federal Act which was specifically aimed at rural areas that the utilities didn't want to spend money to reach, so the fed mandated \"power and phone\" as a kind of universal right. This has also been a theme of the EFF. The basic impulse was also one of the drivers behind Carnegie's huge support of the free library system in the US (the whole story there is interesting, including some of the high minded stipulations in the Carnegie bequests, which I've on occasion tried to get the Internet communities to buy off on).\nEvery Carnegie library had to have two special rooms -- one just for children, and the other where people could be taught to read. Part of the Carnegie money for the libraries supported the reading teachers and sessions. Carnegie was an immigrant and child laborer who could read a little. One of his earliest bosses would open his home library to his workers on Saturdays. Carnegie used this to raise himself up, and never forgot how it happened. (He was also one of the few truly rich people ever who said he was going to give it all away to benefit the civilization around him, and actually did it.)\nP.S.

        "正文": "After the election, I decided to talk to 100 Trump voters from around\nthe country.  I went to the middle of the\ncountry, the middle of the state, and talked to many online.\n\nThis was a surprisingly interesting and helpful experience—I highly\nrecommend it.  With three exceptions, I\nfound something to like about everyone I talked to (though I strongly disagreed with many of the things\nthey said). \nAlthough it shouldn’t have surprised me given the voting data, I was\ndefinitely surprised by the diversity of the people I spoke to—I did not expect\nto talk to so many Muslims, Mexicans, Black people, and women in the course of\nthis project.\n\nAlmost everyone I asked was willing to talk to me, but almost none of\nthem wanted me to use their names—even people from very red states were worried\nabout getting “targeted by those people in Silicon Valley if they knew I voted\nfor him”.  One person in Silicon Valley\neven asked me to sign a confidentiality agreement before she would talk to me,\nas she worried she’d lose her job if people at her company knew she was a\nstrong Trump supporter. \n\nI wanted to understand what Trump voters liked and didn’t like about\nthe president, what they were nervous about, what they thought about the left’s\nresponse so far, and most importantly, what would convince them not to vote for\nhim in the future. \n\nObviously, this is not a poll, and not ‘data’.  But I think narratives are really important.\n\nHere’s what I heard.\n\nThe TL;DR quote is this: \n\n“You all can defeat Trump next time, but not if you keep mocking us,\nrefusing to listen to us, and cutting us out. \nIt’s Republicans, not Democrats, who will take Trump down.” \n\nWhat do you\nlike about Trump?\n\n“He is not\npolitically correct.” Note: This sentiment came up a lot, probably in\nat least a third of the conversations I had.\n\n“He says true but\nunpopular things.  If you can’t talk\nabout problems, you can’t fix them.”\n“I'm a Jewish\nlibertarian who's [sic] grandparents\nwere Holocaust survivors.  Over the last\nfew years the mainstream left has resorted to name-calling and character\nassassination, instead of debate, any time their positions are questioned.  This atmosphere became extremely oppressive\nand threatening to people, like myself, who disagreed with many of Obama's\npolicies over the past several years.  Intelligent\ndebate has become rare.”\n\n“It's a lot like\npolitical discussion was in Soviet Union, actually.  I think the inability to acknowledge obvious\ntruths, and the ever-increasing scope of these restrictions makes it\nparticularly frustrating.  And\npersonally, for whatever reason, I find inability to have more subtle\ndiscussion very frustrating--things are not white or black, but you can't talk\nabout greys since the politically correct answer is white.”\n\n“He is anti-abortion.” Note: This\nsentiment came up a lot.  A number of\npeople I spoke to said they didn’t care about anything else he did and would\nalways vote for whichever candidate was more anti-abortion.“I like that he puts the\ninterests of Americans first.  American\npolicy needs to be made from a position of how Americans benefit from it, as\nthat is the role of government.”\n\n“He is anti-immigration.” Note: This\nsentiment came up a lot.  The most\nsurprising takeaway for me how little it seemed to be driven by economic\nconcerns, and how much it was driven by fears about “losing our culture”,\n“safety”, “community”, and a general Us-vs.-Them mentality. “He will preserve\nour culture.  Preservation of culture is\nconsidered good in most cases.  What’s\nwrong with preserving the good parts of American culture?”\n\n“He’s not Hillary Clinton.”\n\n“I’m Mexican.  I support the wall.  The people who have stayed have destroyed\nMexico, and now they want to get out and cause damage here.  We need to protect our borders, but now any\npolicy is like that is called racist. \nTrump was the first person willing to say that out loud.”\n\n“I am socially very\nliberal.  I am fiscally very\nconservative.  I don't feel I have a\nparty--never have.  I grew up in a more\nsocially conservative time and picked the \"lesser of two evils\"\nduring elections.  Now, the more socially\nliberal side supports bigger governments, more aid and support and that money\nhas to come from somewhere.  I see\nwhat's deducted from my check each week. \nI'm OK with never being rich but I'd like more security and that\ndoesn't come from more government spending.”\n\n“We need borders at every\nlevel of our society.”\n\n“I’m willing to postpone some further social justice progress, which\ndoesn’t really result in loss of life, in favor of less foreign policy\ninvolvement, the opposite of which does.\" \n\n“Brown people are\nalways the out-crowd.  I think\nsubconsciously, part of the reason I supported him was a way to be in the\nin-crowd for once.”\n\n \n\nWhat don’t\nyou like about him? \n\n“The way he talks about women is despicable.”\n\n“Everything about his style.  We\nonly voted for him because this election was too important to worry about\nstyle.”\n\n“I don’t like most things about him. \nThe way it worked is we got to choose one of two terrible options.”\n\n“I think our\nnation needs Trumpism to survive long term, and to me that supersedes almost\nevery other reservation I have.  My issue\nis with Trump himself--I think he's the wrong vessel for his movement, but he's\nall we've got so I'm behind him.” \n\n“I think the\nrollout of the immigration executive order is emblematic of a clusterfuck, to\nbe completely frank.”\n\n“I now believe the\nMuslim ban actually makes us less safe.”\n\n“Isolationism and\nprotectionism at this point is insane. We've done that before.”\n\n“I, too, worry about the\ndishonesty.  His relationship with\nRussia, his relationship with women.  His\nrelationship with questionable financial matters.  These all worry me and were they to continue\nI would lose all respect.”\n\n“He continually plays into a character that he has created\nto rile his fan base. Accepting anti-semitism, white nationalism, or hate\nemanating unnecessarily, creates a vacuum of fear on social media, on\ntelevision, and around the dinner table. \nEven though the policies may be similar to that of any recent Republican\nPresident, the behavior to act so immaturely sets a bad example for children\nand undercuts many cultural norms, which more than anything causes disruption\nto our sociological foundations.”\n\n“I hate that he discredits\nthe press all the time.  That seems to\nforebode great evil.”\n\n \n\nWhat are\nyou nervous about with Trump as president?\n\n“The thing I’m most worried about is war, and that he could destroy\nthe whole world.  I think I may have\nunderestimated that risk, because he is more of an alpha strongman that I\nrealized when I voted for him.  Otherwise\nI still like him.” Note: Most\npeople weren’t that worried about war. \nMore frequent comments were along these lines: \n“I know he’s taking strong positions on certain foreign issues, but I feel in\nnegotiations you need to do things to move the needle and when a whole country\nis watching its hard to keep a poker face, but at least his business track\nrecord overall gives us reason to believe ultimately stability will prevail.”\n\nand\n\n“He’s crazy, but\nit’s a tactic to get other nations not to mess with us.”\n\n“I worry he will drive us apart as a nation.  I believed him when he said that would stop\nwith the campaign, but I haven’t seen signs of it so far.”\n\n“I am nervous that his mental health is actually bad.”\n\n“I worry he is actually going to roll back social change we’ve fought\nso hard for.  But I hope not.”\n\n\n\nWhat do you\nthink about the left’s response so far? \n\n“You need to give us an opportunity to admit we may have been wrong\nwithout saying we’re bad people.  I am\nalready thinking I made a mistake, but I feel ostracized from my community.” \n\n“The left is more intolerant than the right.”  Note: This\nconcept came up a lot, with real animosity in otherwise pleasant conversations.\n\n“Stop calling us racists.  Stop\ncalling us idiots.  We aren’t.  Listen to us when we try to tell you why we\naren’t.  Oh, and stop making fun of us.” \n\n“I’d love to see one-tenth of the outrage about the state of our lives\nout here that you have for Muslims from another country.   You have no idea what our lives are like.”\n\n“I’m so tired of hearing about white privilege.  I’m white, but way less privileged than a\nblack person from your world.  I have no\nhope my life will ever get any better.”\n\n“I am tired\nof feeling silenced and demonized.  We\nhave mostly the same goals, and different opinions about how to get there.  Maybe I’m wrong, maybe you’re wrong.  But enough with calling all of us the devil\nfor wanting to try Trump.  I hate Hillary\nand think she wants to destroy the country of us but I don’t demonize her\nsupporters.” \n\n“I’m angry that they’re so outraged now, but were never outraged over\nan existing terrible system.”\n\n“The attacks against Trump\nhave taught me something about myself. I have defended him and said things I\nreally didn't believe or support because I was put in a defensive position.\nProtesters may have pushed many people in this direction BUT it is ultimately\nour responsibility and must stop.”\n\n“I'd like to also add that the demonization of\nTrump by calling him and his supporters: Nazis, KKK, white supremacists,\nfascists, etc. works very well in entrenching Trump supporters on his side.  These attacks are counter-factual and in my\nopinion very helpful to Trump.” \n\n“So far his election has\ndriven our nation apart.  So far I see\nmost of the divisiveness coming from the left. \nShame on them.  I don't see it\nquite as bad as during Nixon's era but we are truly headed in that\ndirection.  I could not speak with my\nparents during that time because political division would intrude.  This Thanksgiving and holiday season were as\nclose as I've felt to that in 40 years. \nWe are increasingly polarized.  It\ndoesn't seem to be strictly generational, though that exists.  There is an east coast-west coast, rural vs.\nurban, racial, and gender division forming now. \nIt has the potential to be devastating.” \n\n“The\namount of violent attacks and economic attacks perpetrated by the left\nare troublesome.  My wife and I\nrecently moved to the Bay Area.  I\nwas expecting a place which was a welcoming meritocracy of ideas.  Instead, I found a place where everyone\nconstantly watches everyone else for any thoughtcrime.” \n\n“Silicon Valley is\nincredibly unwelcoming to alternative points of view.  Your curiosity, if it is sincere, is the very\nrare exception to the rule.”\n\n“There is something\nhypocritical about the left saying the are uniters not dividers, they are\ninclusive and then excluding half the population with comments on intelligence\nand irrelevance in the modern world.”\n\n \n\nWhat would\nconvince you not to vote for him again?\n\n“War would be unforgivable.”\n\n“If the Russia thing were true, I’d turn against him.  Why don’t y’all focus on that instead of his\ntweets?”\n\n“Give us a better option, and we’ll be happy.  But it needs to be a moderate—Sanders won’t\nwin.”\n\n“I’ll happily vote for someone else. \nThere’s a lot I hate about Trump. \nBut our lives are basically destroyed, and he was the first person to\ntalk about fixing that.”\n\n“Generally hard to say.  Extreme\ncorruption would do it.”\n\nSecond\nperson in the same conversation: “I don’t care if he’s corrupt.  Y’all voted for Hillary and she was the most\ncorrupt candidate of all time.”\n\n“Another worry is\nan escalation of overreaches between him and the left that culminates in the\nbreakdown of our system of law.  I'd hold\nhim responsible for that.”\n\n“If he were to get\nthe US involved in a major military conflict (I think the odds of this have\nactually decreased versus Hillary, but I'm willing to be proven wrong). If he\nwere to substantially increase the cost of doing business (by increasing\nregulation or taxes for instance).”\n\n“I'm socially very\nliberal. If he were to do something like restart a war on drugs, try to\nrestrict rights of LGBT, or make first trimester abortions difficult or\ndangerous, I'd rethink my position.  I\nthink these type of things are extremely unlikely though, especially with an\nelection a few years away the country as a whole becoming more socially\nliberal.”\n\n“I think if 2008\nhappened again (further into Trump's tenure, so that causation can be shown,\nhypothetically), the base would evaporate.” \n\n“Based on Trump's\nhistory before politics I don't believe he is racist, sexist, homophobic or\nbigoted.  If that were true it would\nsupersede everything else since it would be even worse for individual liberty\nand freedom than any freedom of speech restrictions or increases in government\nsize proposed by the Democratic Party.”"

        "正文": "Dear YC Community:In response to a comment on Hacker News, I’m going to try writing an annual letter to the YC community with an update on our progress.Our mission is to enable the most innovation of any company in the world in order to make the future great for everyone.  We believe new technology, economic growth, and new ideas about how our society might function are more important than ever before.As of January 1, 2017, YC has funded over 3,200 founders and 1,470 companies.  This year, assuming there is not a macroeconomic meltdown, we expect the total valuation of companies that have gone through our program to surpass $100 billion.  We have also funded more than 30 non-profits.As always, most of the credit goes to our founders—they, and the astonishingly strong and helpful community they create, are what make YC special.  The second-most credit goes to our team—I am incredibly thankful to work with such a talented and driven group of people.YC Companies & InvestmentsWe invested about $27 million in the Winter and Summer 2016 batches, and so far we have invested about $187 million in later-stage investments from our first Continuity fund.We are excited to fund companies in any space that we believe is good for the world and can eventually sustain a very large company.  Some of the many areas we’re interested in are noted in our Requests for Startups.Our largest exit of 2016 was Cruise, a self-driving car company.  We expect to fund many more machine learning-driven companies in the future (I will generally avoid calling out trends in these letters, because I’ve noticed doing that produced unintended consequences, but this one is so obvious and so important that I’m happy to mention it).Helion, Oklo, and Bright are all working toward inexpensive clean energy, an area of great interest to us.  LendUp and Coinbase are two examples of YC companies innovating in financial services technology.  Boom and Relativity Space are pursuing strategies in aerospace that most companies haven’t pursued seriously in a long time, or ever.Gingko Bioworks is learning how to design new organisms, and Science Exchange is making it easier to get new experiments done.  FarmLogs is making it easier and more efficient to grow food, and Gobble, Instacart and Doordash are making it easier to eat it.  Reddit and 9Gag continue to make me waste enormous amounts of time, but I love every minute I waste.  Docker, PlanGrid, Checkr, Flexport, Gusto are just a few of the enterprise companies we’ve seen begin to thrive.  Machine Zone has become one of the largest gaming companies in the world.  Rappi, Wave, and Strikingly are some of the many YC companies succeeding on other continents.In addition to the three companies we are currently best known for—Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe—more than 50 of our companies are worth more than $100 million each.We’ve funded a lot of other companies, but in the spirit of not exhausting your patience, I’ll stop listing them here.HyperscaleThere’s one more trend I want to mention, though it’s not about a specific market.  I think we’re now in the era of hyperscale technology companies.  If you believe Metcalfe’s law, it stands to reason that network-effected technology companies are now far more powerful than ever before, simply because the number of people connected to the internet keeps getting bigger, and n^2 gets big really fast.Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have powerful advantages that are still not fully understood by most founders and investors.  I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well, have significant data and computation advantages, be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers, and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts.  This trend is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action, and I suggest people carefully consider its implications for startups.  There will of course be areas where these companies are naturally weaker, and these are good areas to start companies.Diversity & InclusionIn 2016, we funded 68 female founders at 52 companies. About 22.3% of the companies we funded had a woman on the founding team, and about 12.5% of the founders we funded were women.  In 2016, we funded 52 Black and Latino founders at 29 companies.  11.6% of the founders we funded were Black or Latino.The percentage of women who apply to YC is roughly the same as the percentage of women who get funded.  The same is true for Black and Latino founders.From the data we have available, it seems that the percentage of women and people of color applying to YC is higher than the overall percentage of women and people of color starting startups.  This is encouraging, but we continue to want to understand and address the barriers that prevent more founders from underrepresented groups from starting startups and applying to YC.  We still have a long way to go.While we remain committed to helping more underrepresented founders get started, we believe that’s only part of the solution.  We still see significant dropoffs at the stages after YC (e.g. raising late-stage capital).  The larger startup community needs to consider how little the unicorn-founder demographics resemble the early-stage demographics.There’s clearly a lot more work to do here, and we’re committed to help do it.  We’re hosting our fourth annual Female Founders Conference this year in June, continuing our Open Office Hours with underrepresented communities and bringing in unconscious bias experts to train our team.  We’re always open to hearing how we can do a better job, so if you’ve come across practices or programs that work well to support diverse founders, please let us know.YC OrganizationY Combinator is currently made up of 5 groups.  I’ll talk a little about each of them here.  We expect to add several more over the next few years, and in general you should expect us to try a lot of stuff (though of course not all of it will work).  You should also expect us to continue to grow the number of companies we fund.YC (our flagship program)In October of 2016, Michael Seibel took over responsibility for our main program as CEO of YC.  He’s doing an outstanding job, and I expect the program to significantly strengthen over the course of 2017 and beyond.In 2016 (and the first part of 2017), we added three remarkable partners to the flagship group: Tim Brady, Adora Cheung and Daniel Gross.One of my partners that I’d like to especially thank is Dalton Caldwell.  Dalton has been a YC partner since 2013, and now runs our admissions team, which is perhaps the most important function we have.  Dalton has taken a process that used to be stressful and deeply imperfect and improved it by a huge amount.  Though I’m sure we’ll still make mistakes, I sleep better at night thinking that we’re making far fewer in this area than we used to.While I’m on the topic of recognizing partners, I’d also like to thank the three partners at YC that get some of the least public recognition.  Kirsty Nathoo is our CFO, and Jon and Carolynn Levy are our General Counsels.  They are full partners at YC but since they don’t advise our companies (as much) on business as the other partners, they are less well-known.  However, they work incredibly hard and thoughtfully, and they are one of the secrets to our success.  In fact, one of our most successful founders recently said to me “I tell every startup I meet they should do YC, and the reason is Jon Levy.  I don’t get how he managed to take my calls at all hours of the day, because the other founders in my batch said he did the same for them, but he solved more problems for us than I can count, and also just listened to me when I had a bad day.”Finally, I’d like to thank our entire software team, lead by my partner Jared Friedman.  We’ve had an incredible improvement in our software over the past year, and someday when the history of YC is written, I expect that people will talk about software as one of our secret weapons.  This shouldn’t be so secret—one might reasonably expect technology investors to understand the importance of great software for themselves—but it is generally not the case.We give companies in this program $120k for 7% ownership in their company, and work with them intensively for 3 months and then less intensively for the rest of the company’s life.  We run this program twice a year, and currently fund about 125 companies per batch. While at YC, founders get access to a range of resources, advice, connections, and special deals.Anyone can apply on our website, and all sorts of people do (here are some common misconceptions about who YC accepts).Companies often ask us how we decide who gets into YC.  There are four questions I consider:1) Will this company build something lots of people really love?If so, and if ‘lots’ is sufficiently large, the company has the chance to produce substantial earnings.2) Will this company be easy to copy?The most successful companies I’ve worked with have a significant competitive advantage—network effect, proprietary technology, complex coordination, or barrier to entry of some other sort.  I understand in theory it’s possible to build a very successful commodity company, but I don’t know how to do it.3) Will these founders develop into “forces of nature”?As most people say, it’s hard to make money unless you invest in great founders.  Defining what that means is usually left as an exercise to the reader.  Here are some questions I ask myself: Are these founders relentlessly determined?  Are they original thinkers?  Are they smart, and especially do they have new insights I haven’t heard before?  Are they good communicators (and so will they be able to hire, sell, raise money, talk to the press, etc)?  Are they focused and intense?  Do they always seem to find a way around obstacles?  Would I work for them?This is the often the hardest factor for me to evaluate, because you have to make a judgment about trajectory—you are trying to predict where someone will be in five years.4) Does this company have a clear and important mission?Without this, I usually get bored.  More importantly, companies that don’t have this usually have a hard time recruiting enough great people to work with them, and thus struggle to become very large.We especially like founders who have some sort of non-traditional background; we are somewhat suspicious of founders with extremely “tracked” lives.  Startups are not a resume item, and we don’t like founders who view YC as a stop on the way to B-school.  Although in many ways it’s a good problem to have, the increase in the value of YC’s brand means we have to work harder to find people doing a startup for the right reason: to bring an idea they’re obsessed with to life, and willing to do something unreasonable to see it happen.We have had great success funding “unknown” people, and we will keep doing this—it’s one of our two or three best secrets.  Please help us spread the message: you don’t need to be experienced, well-known, or have an impressive resume to get into YC.  We fund smart, ambitious people with a great idea and evidence that they can build things.If you know a founder who should apply to YC, you can recommend them to us. That said, companies don’t need a recommendation or introduction, and most companies we fund don’t have one.As I mentioned before, I think the strength and quality of our community is one of the most important things we have to offer.  As with any community, this emerges from a complex set of factors, but I’ll mention three here.One of the most important cultural values PG and Jessica put in place was to do the right thing for founders, even when it is not in our own short-term interest.  When I was going through YC, it was the thing that most stuck out to me as different from other investors.Another cultural value they created is to try to fund only good people (in the sense of doing the right thing, though separately we evaluate for effectiveness).  We sometimes get this very wrong, and dealing with the repercussions is the most unpleasant part of our job.  However, we manage to get it right a lot.Thirdly, we have a ‘pay-it-forward’ mentality.  Startups in the batch know they can ask any alumni for help, well beyond normal Silicon Valley expectations.  Later, when they’re successful alumni, they help new companies without us ever asking.YC ContinuityYC Continuity is our growth-stage fund.  We started it in 2015, and it’s run by Ali Rowghani.  Last year, Anu Hariharan joined as our second YC Continuity partner.We do this to provide a source of friendly growth-stage capital to companies and founders that go through the YC program, especially to companies that other investors may not fully understand.  We also hope to be a force for good in the growth-stage investing market.YC Continuity will begin to experiment with programs to provide more advice and resources to growth-stage companies in 2017.YC ResearchYC Research is a non-profit research division of YC.  Although we think startups are a good structure to align people to solve a problem, they are clearly not the best solution for everything.  For some important problems, a non-profit research lab is a good approach.We sometimes fund and run internal groups, and sometimes fund external organizations.So far there are 5 groups: Basic Income, OpenAI, HARC, New Cities, and Universal Healthcare.Basic Income is studying the effects of giving people unconditional monthly cash.  We are currently in our pilot phase in Oakland.  We are continuing to learn and make changes, and work with various public agencies and governments to enable the full-scale study.  We are planning to run a larger study than we originally intended, and we hope to start fundraising for it soon.OpenAI is trying to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity.  In our first year, we released Gym, Universe, and a number of new ideas that were at the limits of my understanding but that I enjoyed reading about.  In 2017, we hope to achieve significant new milestones that are not possible with current AI technology.HARC is a group headed by Alan Kay inventing new ways for humans to learn and understand more.  My visit to Bret Victor’s lab last year, which is a sort of computerized interactive room, remains one of the new technologies I think most about.New Cities is still in the exploration phase, but we hope to have more to share over the course of this year.Universal Healthcare is a project on which we are partnering with Watsi to study how we can use technology to make healthcare both better and more affordable.We grew a little faster than we were expecting, so we are trying to take a breather on further growth at YCR.  But we may still add one more group in 2017.Startup SchoolStartup School is our new MOOC (which we will supplement with our existing series of conferences).  It will be open to anyone (unless we get absolutely overwhelmed with interest) and is free.  We will stream talks like the ones that happen during YC dinners, provide advice to startups, and help them connect to other startups in the program and other people that may be helpful.Although we clearly stand to gain from this, we are doing it because we believe spreading the message about entrepreneurship and making the necessary information, community, and connections freely accessible to everyone who might want to start a company is important.This year, I’ll be teaching it.If this goes well, we hope to offer it every year.  In future years, we also hope to explore how something like ‘financial aid’ might work for people that need a small amount of capital to help get their startup going.Hacker NewsHacker News (HN) is an internet forum, created by Paul Graham shortly after YC got started and now run by Daniel Gackle.  Its original purpose was to try out the programming language PG was developing—a dialect of Lisp called Arc, that HN still proudly uses today—and to be a place to find interesting things to read.HN’s initial users were fans of the essays PG had been publishing about startups, programming, and a lot of other things.  Soon it became a hub for everyone interested in YC and startups YC was funding.  YC and HN grew up together, and many YC founders started as HN users.HN remains focused on startups, programming, and lots of other things—anything intellectually interesting goes.  The HN community has developed many unique features over the years, such as the \"Show HN\" format, where users share something they've made, and monthly \"Who Is Hiring\" threads that have helped many community members find jobs.Hacker News has 3.4 million users per month and 350,000 users per day, with 4 million pageviews a day.  There are just under 1 million registered accounts, with several hundred added each day.  Users post around 1,000 articles and 6,000 comments to the site per day.These numbers are all growing, but relatively slowly, and we like it that way.  Internet forums are notorious for degrading over time--one of the ways PG described HN was as an experiment in seeing how long a forum could stay good before it deteriorated.  We've mostly managed to stave that off, for 10 years now, but we're always mindful of this risk.HN has grown into the leading community for tech and startups on the internet, known for its emphasis on civil, substantive discussion—at least in theory!  Our team affectionately refers to HN as \"the worst internet forum, except for all the others\".-----We are only about 30 years into the age of software, about 20 years into the age of the internet, and about 2 years into the age of artificial intelligence.  Each of these by themselves is a technology revolution that I believe we will look back on as being extremely significant; taken together, I believe they will represent the most significant technology revolution in human history—I believe we are likely to have less in common with whatever we call the most intelligent species on the planet in 600 years than we did with humans 60,000 years ago.It’s an exciting time to do what we do.Sam AltmanPresident, YC

        "正文": "It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about\nsome of the actions taken by President Trump’s administration.\n\nThere are many actions from his first week that are\nobjectionable.  In repeatedly\ninvoking unsubstantiated conspiracy theories (like the 3 million illegal\nvotes), he's delegitimizing his opponents and continuing to damage our\nsociety.  So much objectionable\naction makes it hard to know where and when to focus, and outrage fatigue is an\neffective strategy.\n\nBut the executive order from yesterday titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry\nInto the United States” is tantamount to a Muslim ban and requires objection.  I am obviously in favor of safety and rules, but\nbroad-strokes actions targeted at a specific religious group is the wrong solution,\nand a first step toward a further reduction in rights.\n\nIn addition, the precedent of invalidating already-issued visas\nand green cards should be extremely troubling for immigrants of any country or\nfor anyone who thinks their contributions to the US are important.  This is not just a Muslim ban.  This is a breach of America's contract with all\nthe immigrants in the nation.\n\nThis administration has already\nshown that they are not particularly impressed by the first amendment, and that\nthey are interested in other anti-immigrant action.  So we must object, or our inaction will send\na message that the administration can continue to take away our rights.  \n\nIn doing so, we should not\ndemonize Trump voters—most of them voted for him for reasons other than the\npromise of a Muslim ban.  We need their\neventual support in resisting actions like these, and we will not get it if we\nfurther isolate them. \n\nThe tech community is\npowerful.  Large tech companies in particular\nhave enormous power and are held in high regard.  We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and\nunequivocally.  Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers—if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech companies go to extraordinary\nlengths to recruit and retain employees; those employees have a lot of\nleverage.  If employees push companies to do something, I believe they’ll have to.  \n\nAt a minimum, companies should\ntake a public stance.  But talking is\nonly somewhat effective, and employees should push their companies to figure\nout what actions they can take.  I wish I\nhad better ideas here, but we’re going to have a meeting on Friday at Y\nCombinator to discuss.  I’d love to see\nother tech companies do the same. \n\nIf this action has not crossed a\nline for you, I suggest you think now about what your own line in the sand\nis.  It’s easy, with gradual escalation,\nfor the definition of ‘acceptable’ to get moved.  So think now about what action President\nTrump might take that you would consider crossing a line, and write it down.  \n\nAlmost every member of the GOP I have spoken to knows that these\nactions are wrong.  Paul Ryan, Mike\nPence, Kevin McCarthy and James Mattis said so themselves when Trump first\nproposed his Muslim ban.  We need to\nremind anyone involved in this administration that, for the rest of their\nlives, they will have to explain why they were complicit in this. \n\nIn my first post on Trump last June,\nI said it would be a good time for all of us to start speaking up.  We are\nnow at the stage where something is starting that is going to be taught in\nhistory classes, and not in a good way.  This morning, Kellyanne Conway\nposted on Twitter that Trump is \"a man of action\" who is \"just\ngetting started\".  I believe her.  We must now start speaking\nup."

        "正文": "The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect–for one thing, I think health insurance should be entirely separate from employment–but I hate the thought of losing it without a replacement for people who will lose insurance. If Congress ends up repealing it, I hope they earnestly try to preserve the best parts, and put in place something better.One thing the ACA definitely did was help a lot of founders start their companies--without it, being a founder would make sense for less people. The Department of Health and Human Services released a lot of new data yesterday showing how the ACA helped support entrepreneurs, and in light of that, I thought it would be good to collect and share stories of how the ACA helped some Y Combinator founders get started.Here they are in the founders’ own words:Dan Carroll, Clever, S12March 3, 2012: I'm holed up in a hotel room in San Francisco with two of my best friends, wildly excited about the idea that will become Clever. We've packed the day with difficult conversations – Where will the company be founded? Do we have enough savings? Who will be CEO? – but the only topic that I'm truly afraid of is health. I've been living with Crohn's Disease for nearly ten years, and I know that without health care, I'd die, and without health insurance, I'd go broke. But some quick research tells me that, thanks to the ACA, I can join my parents' healthcare plan until I turn 26 the following January. Risk mitigated, I make the commitment to my cofounders - I'm in.Ethan Perlstein, Perlara, W16I left academia on Jan 1, 2013 as unemployed former postdoc. I would not have been able to move across the country to start my company, and my wife wouldn't have given up her employer-sponsored health insurance, if not for Obamacare. Also, some of the first employees at Perlara depended on the ACA for insurance.Randall Bennett, VidPresso, W14 There's a good chance that without the aca my startup wouldn't exist... or I'd be dead. When launching my startup we couldn't get health insurance because one insurer denied us because I once had a sleep study for sleep apnea. Once you get one rejection, all the others reject you.Then, last year I had a brain tumor. I had moved off to a more normal health plan... but with the last set of rules chances are it'd have been unlikely I could have gotten any insurance, let alone a somewhat reasonable plan. Ben Maitland-Lewis, Pretty Instant, W15We aren't yet at a stage where we can offer healthcare to our employees but thanks to the ACA we are all individually insured. This has been instrumental in helping us grow the business while keeping costs low. I hope the next administration doesn't repeal our access to individualized affordable healthcare as it would have a direct effect on the company at this stage.Ravi Parikh, Heap, W13The provision in ACA that allows young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance until they're 26 has helped me multiple times. In 2011, I was self-employed as a musician, which would have been much more difficult to pursue if I weren't able to take advantage of my parents' health insurance. Later, my co-founder Matin left his job at Facebook in 2012. He and I worked on a number of side projects, one of which eventually became Heap. Both him and I remained on our parents' insurance until Heap had enough funding and traction to offer health plans to employees. Again, without being able to remain on our parents' insurance, this would have been much more difficult.Mike Romano, Lendsnap, S16The ACA has been a blessing for me and my family, and without it, I could not pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I began my new career within days of the birth of my son, and the fact he arrived five weeks early only complicated plans further. My wife is a graphic designer and usually only finds contract work without benefits. The ACA allows me to follow my passion of transforming the mortgage industry while ensuring our son gets the crucial care he needs during his early life.Brian Merritt, Seed, W15For me, the ACA was life changing. Prior to the ACA I was only able to obtain insurance either through an established group plan, or via Medical/Medicaid “last resort” insurance. This was because I have a pre-existing condition that made me ineligible to buy an individual insurance plan. Due to having a chronic condition that needs to be managed carefully, having a quality insurance plan was not an option, but a requirement. So my only option was to work for a large employer with an established health plan that would provide me with the appropriate benefits to support my situation. After the ACA made it so that pre-existing conditions don’t disqualify applicants, I was able to purchase an individual insurance plan outside of my employer, and as as a result I was able to start a company and work on it for almost two years before we were able to put our own group plan together.Mick Johnson, Whereoscope, S10The ACA was essential when starting my new business - I founded the company, was pre-funding for 9 months, and the only employee, so was unable to get small group coverage. I have a wife, a child, and another child on the way so health insurance was essential. Without the ACA I could never have left a regular job to found this new company, which has now raised funding and employs 7 people. Kevin Law, Cambly, W14I had to apply for individual health care twice while starting Cambly before the ACA exchanges launched at the end of 2013. It was incredibly difficult and expensive, because I had to keep paying for expensive COBRA coverage from my previous employer while repeatedly applying, appealing, and getting rejected by insurers for individual plans. I was still on a group plan during the ACA debates and assumed that the only people getting rejected were the chronically ill. I learned through my experience that nearly anyone who had past health care expenses would often be rejected when applying for individual plans (as was my case).An especially ironic moment occurred when I was on a Blue Cross group plan via COBRA and appealing a rejection for a Blue Cross individual plan. I got a physical, so my doctor could write a letter saying I was in good health for the appeal. I simultaneously received a rejection letter for my individual plan appeal citing pasts health costs AND a letter from my group plan asking if the physical was related to a workplace incident (presumably so they could sue someone to get reimbursed for the costs).The exchanges finally went live at the end of 2013, and I quickly got insurance coverage. No extensive health history paperwork. No rejections or appeals. It launched right around when we got into YC, so it was great to focus on building and growing our business rather than trying to obtain health insurance.Tristan Tao, Leada, S15I'm currently 24 years old (going on 25). I am fortunately covered under my parent's health insurance under ACA (until I'm 26). This was critical in reducing my personal burn. I would not go without health insurance; this meant I'd have to either join a larger company to gain coverage, or purchase them out of pocket. Either way it would've significantly hindered the 22 yrs old me to start a company as a Senior in College.I strongly hope that the successor of Obamacare will include a clause that makes it cheaper for recent graduates to get coverage (or retain the current policy of enabling people younger than 26 to stay on their parents' coverage).Looking back, the largest hindrance to starting a company would've been debt (which I didn't have any), and personal burn (insurance being a huge part).Ram Jayaraman, PlateIQ, S155 out of 7 members of the initial team at Plate IQ were on ACA. Without ACA in the early days we would have to spend large amounts on employer health insurance and since the team was small we would not have gotten much discounts either. Since the team just needed something basic until we raise decent venture money, they were all able to find very affordable options with good networks like Kaiser.In thinking of an ACA successor: very few plans are coupled with HSA accounts and HSA withdrawals are penalized. For startups with young teams I would ideally like to continue getting plans with large deductibles and large co-pays and instead contribute to an HSA account. Avoiding the 20% penalty for the HSA withdrawal would definitely encourage more participation.Ben Thompson, Gitprime, W16I have a family of 5. Had it not been for the affordable care act, it would have been incredibly difficult to take the leap to become a co-founder. Because of the ACA, I was able to take a calculated career risk without having to sacrifice health coverage for my family as part of that decision. Two years later, we’ve built a company that provides benefits for all of our employees and their dependents.Brendan Lim, Kicksend, S11In 2009 my wife was in a life threatening car accident. After her recovery, she was unable to get reasonably priced coverage due to her new \"pre-existing conditions\". During this time, my co-founder and I had quit our jobs and started working on Kicksend (S11) and were living off of our savings. As a result, we were unable to afford reasonable insurance. The ACA removed the \"pre-existing conditions\" and gave us peace of mind since my wife was finally able to get covered.Vishal Joshi, Joy, S16When we started Joy, we had insurance as dependents and did not need to create company healthcare offer for a bit.  But soon we had a new employee very eager to join Joy but needed health insurance.  We agreed to start the process but it so happens that the entire ordeal to get company healthcare setup takes a couple of months.  If not for ACA, Joy would had lost a really good employee who is still with us and actually helped us build our website.  She was able to keep afloat using ACA while we got our company policy setup.Jason Chen, Verge Genomics, S15The Affordable Care Act makes it easy for us to purchase and manage health insurance plans – all of our employees are covered rapidly with no medical underwriting. However, we pay high premiums, incur rising deductibles, and plans are bloated with benefits we cannot use. We have also had to pay for \"retroactive coverage\" for some employees to avoid penalties from the individual mandate, even though no services were used. Future patient-centered health reform should facilitate access to coverage for small business and individuals while allowing greater customization of benefits.Zachary Garbow, SocialBrowse, W08When I began working on my startup full time, my wife and I wanted to start a family. At that time, when trying to purchase private insurance being pregnant was considered a pre-existing condition. My wife also had undertaken some preventative procedures years earlier, which made it difficult to obtain coverage. As a result, we were stressed and anxious about not being able to get coverage, and fearful that we'd not be covered for our pregnancy and I'd have to quit my startup to find a corporate job with health insurance. Luckily, the ACA passed just in time to provide us the peace of mind to both start our family and continue building my startup. We now have 2 kids and a thriving, growing business.Varun Aroroa, OpenCurriculum, W14ACA has allowed me to have health insurance. Before I got on Obamacare, I had no insurance and had stopped all physical activity beyond basic exercise for years, being too scared to hurt myself. Living below the adjusted poverty line, I just can't afford normal plans. It is amazing how much mental comfort and freedom it can bring in life.Mike Knoop, Zapier, S12Thanks to the ACA and my parents, the provision to cover dependents through the age of 26 enabled me to take more risk starting Zapier. Specifically, I did not have to worry about healthcare coverage when the company was small and could not afford health benefits. Now, Zapier provides health benefit coverage to our 50+ US employees.Zachariah Reitano, Shout, S14I had heart surgery when I was 18. I was virtually uninsurable. I now have health insurance. Why we need the ACA is no more complicated than that."

His bill would make it so multi-family buildings are automatically approved by right as long as they comply with local zoning, and have 5-20% affordable units--the percentage depending on location and subsidy offered.The bill is currently being debated in California's State Legislature as part of the upcoming annual budget, which will be voted on on June 15.

[2] In my opinion, Jeremy’s claim is completely\nbaseless and opportunistic—it obviously comes at a bad time for the company\nwith the merger still pending, and Kyle understandably wanted to avoid a\nprotracted litigation.  Kyle has worked\nincredibly hard to settle this claim amicably, despite what I consider to be\nthe obvious ridiculousness of it, and has done far more than I would have\npersonally done under these circumstances.\n\nKyle and Cruise are now suing Jeremy for making a false equity\nclaim.  It’s an incredible bummer these situations have to happen in the\nfirst place.  This is one of the least\nsensible professional situations I’ve ever been involved with, but\nunfortunately these situations are not uncommon.\n\nI recognize that I place myself at risk talking about this, but\nit’s time that someone speaks publicly about situations like what is happening\nat Cruise.  And so I’ve decided to say\nsomething before the lawyers can stop me. \nEven with this issue, both sides still expect the merger to close on\nschedule in Q2.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n[1] Kyle and Jeremy applied to YC together but Jeremy left\nbefore the YC interview.  Neither took a salary, and Kyle was funding the\ncompany by himself at that point.\n\nAccording to Kyle, Jeremy did not write any code or build any\nhardware during this exploratory period.  He did help find an office for\nthe company.  At the point of Jeremy’s departure, neither he nor Kyle had\nsigned employment agreements, stock agreements, or any documents of any sort\nwith the company.  Even if Jeremy had signed a stock agreement, he\nwouldn’t have reached the standard 1-year cliff for founders to vest any\nequity.\n\nKyle told me that Jeremy would occasionally reach out to\ncongratulate him on press about Cruise (for example, he reached out to\ncongratulate Kyle on Cruise’s Series A), but he never asked for anything—until\nnow, when, in my opinion, he saw an opportunity to make a ton of money.\n\n[2] I was personally involved all day on Friday last week to try\nto help settle this claim.  Given the time pressure because of the pending\nmerger, we had to set a Friday at 5 pm deadline for Kyle’s offer, which Jeremy\nlet expire. "

[1] I saw terms recently that had a 2x liquidation\npreference (i.e. the investors got the first 2x their money out of the company\nwhen it exited) and a 3x liquidation cap (i.e. after they made 3x their money,\nthey didn’t get any more of the proceeds).\n\nThis is hardly an equity instrument at all. [2] The example here is an extreme case, but not\nwildly so.  Investors are buying debt but\ndressing it up close enough to equity to maintain their venture capital fund\nexemption status.  In a world of 0\npercent interest rates, people become pretty focused on finding new sources for\nfixed income.\n\nThere is a massive disconnect in late-stage preferred stock, because if\nyou’re using it to synthesize debt it doesn’t matter what the price is.  The closer the rounds get to common stock (a\nless-than-1x liquidation preference, for example), the more I think the\nvaluation means something. \nUnsurprisingly, the best companies usually have the most common-stock-like\nterms (and “the best companies” are never the ones that seem overpriced for\nlong anyway).\n\nSome of this debt is poorly underwritten.  Some unicorns will surely die (and those are\nthe ones everyone will talk about).  That\ndoesn’t make it a tech bubble.  It’d be\nmore accurate to say it’s a tech bubble if no unicorns die in the next couple\nof years. \n\nTo summarize: there does not appear to be a tech bubble in\nthe public markets.  There does not\nappear to be a bubble in early or mid stages of the private markets.  There does appear to be a bubble in the\nlate-stage private companies, but that’s because people are misunderstanding\nthese financial instruments as equity. \nIf you reclassify those rounds as debt, then it gets hard to say where\nexactly the bubble is.\n\nAt some point, I expect LPs to realize that buying debt in\nlate-stage tech companies is not what they signed up for, and then prices in\nlate-stage private companies will appear to correct.  And I think that the entire public market is\nlikely to go down—perhaps substantially—when interest rates materially move up,\nthough that may be a long time away.  But\nI expect public tech companies are likely to trade with the rest of the market and\nnot underperform. \n\nBut no matter what happens in the short- and medium-term, I continue to believe technology is the future, and I still can’t think of an asset I’d\nrather own and not think about for a decade or two than a basket of public or\nprivate tech stocks.\n\n \n\n \n\nThanks to Jack Altman, Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, Aaron\nLevie, Geoff Ralston, and Ali Rowghani for reading draft of this. \n\n[1] There are real problems with these distorted \"valuations\".  Employees these companies\nhire often think of them as real valuations. \nIt also often makes the company think of itself as much bigger than it\nis, and do the wrong things for its actual stage.  Finally, too much cheap money lets companies\noperate with bad unit economics and cover up all sorts of internal\nproblems.  So I think many companies are\nhurting themselves with access to easy capital.\n\n[2] Even before the shift to debt-like rounds, the\ndisconnect between how much people will pay for 5% of a company in preferred\nstock vs. 100% of a company in common stock was massive (and for good\nreason--the downside protection alone with preferred stock makes it much different than common stock).  As this delta has accentuated,\nthe public/private disconnect has gotten worse, and caused a number of\nproblems for companies accustomed to valuations always going up."

        "正文": "Airbnb has recently been attacked by San Francisco politicians for driving up the price of housing in the city.  San Francisco has tried, and will continue to try, to ban Airbnb in various ways.  Last week, this excellent post was published on Prop F—“the Airbnb law”. I recently reached out to Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, to learn more about this. I am decidedly a non-expert on this topic, but here are some thoughts from a layperson.I met Brian in 2008, when he started Airbedandbreakfast as…an affordable housing company.  He couldn’t afford to pay his rent in 10 days and his credit cards were maxed out.  He looked around and realized that he did have one asset he could monetize—his extra space.  And eventually, Airbnb was born and the sharing economy began.Unfortunately, a lot of other people have problems paying their rent or mortgage.  75% of Airbnb hosts in San Francisco say that their income from Airbnb helps them stay in their homes, and 60% of the Airbnb income goes to rent/mortgage and other housing expenses. Making it harder to use Airbnb in San Francisco may make it impossible for some of these hosts to afford to stay in their homes and in this city.In 2014 (the most recent year with available data) there were about 387,000 housing units in SF.  About 38% were owner-occupied, and the remaining 62% or 240,000 were rental units.  About 33,000 of these were vacant, generally as a side effect of rent control laws.  (I don’t honestly know if rent control is a net good or bad thing—I assume more good than bad—but it certainly keeps units off the market.) [1]In the past year, only about 340 units in SF were rented on Airbnb more than 211 nights, which is what Airbnb has calculated as the break-even point compared to long-term rental.  This is less than one out of every thousand units of housing in SF.  Looking at it another way, it’s just over 1.1% of all unoccupied units.  There have been about 10,700 SF units that have rented on Airbnb in the last year (obviously a much lower number of units are actively listed at any particular time).  The median number of trips per unit was 5, and mean was 13.3.  The mean revenue per host was about $13,000 per year.  More than 90 percent of Airbnb hosts in SF are listing their primary residence, and making money with an extra room or their entire place when they are out of town.The whole magic of the sharing economy is better asset utilization and thus lower prices for everyone.  Home sharing makes better utilization out of a fixed asset, and by more optimally filling space it means the same number of people can use less supply.  In fact, Airbnb worked with economist Tom Davidoff of the University of British Columbia and found that Airbnb has affected the price of housing in SF by less than 1% either up or down.But in the last 5 years, the cost of housing in the city has about doubled.  The reason for this is a lot more people want to live in SF than we have housing for, and the city has been slow to approve new construction.  Who is to blame for this?  The same politicians that are trying to distract you with Airbnb’s 340 “professionally rented” units.What should the politicians actually be doing about the housing crunch?  The obvious answer would be to support building more housing and fixing the supply side of the equation.  But instead they’re doing the opposite (e.g. a moratorium on new construction in the Mission) and trying to turn Airbnb into a scapegoat.I love San Francisco. I wish housing here were much cheaper.  This is a special city and more people are going to want to live here, and more are going to want to come visit and do business with people here. Instead of trying to ban the future, we should be making it easier for middle class families to stay in the city.  We can do this by building more units to push the market price of housing down and by making it easier for San Franciscans to share their homes.[1] Selected Housing Characteristics, 2014 American Community Survey 1-Year EstimatesDisclosure: I own a significant amount of Airbnb stock."

        "正文": "At the end of a YC batch, the general consensus among the partners is that about 25% of the companies are on a trajectory that could lead to a multi-billion dollar company.  Of course, only a handful of them do.  Most go on to be decent or bad.\nThese companies have a beautifully exponential growth curve during YC, and then a few months after YC is over, it essentially flatlines.  Because it would be so much better for us if this did not happen, we wonder a lot about why.\nThe main problem is that companies stop doing what they were doing during YC—instead of relentlessly focusing on building a great product and growing, they focus on everything else.  They also work less hard and less effectively—the peer pressure during YC is a powerful force.\nThe startups justify this to themselves in all sorts of ways—“We’re doing some longer-term strategic work.  You wouldn’t understand.” “We’re cleaning up our technical debt.” “We’re building out the organization.” “We’re focusing on PR for this month.  I’m going to speak at 6 conferences and writing two thought leadership pieces.” “We are different; growth isn’t our most important thing.” We’ve heard all of these from startups that have gone on to disappoint.\nIn general, startups get distracted by fake work.  Fake work is both easier and more fun than real work for many founders.  Two particularly bad cases are raising money and getting personal press; we’ve seen many promising founders fall in love with one or (usually) both of these, which nearly always ends badly.  But the list of fake work is long.\nI tell founders to consider how directly a task relates to growing.  Obviously, building and selling are the best.  Things like hiring are also very high on the list—you will need to hire to sustain your growth rate at some point.  Interviewing lots of lawyers has got to be near the bottom.\nDuring YC, we are ruthless about reminding startups that fake work does not count and will still get you a failed startup no matter how intensely you do it.  We are also ruthless about asking for your progress, and being honest with you if things aren’t working.  After YC, we have less contact with startups—you can go dark on us if you want.  This, by itself, is almost always a sign that a startup is doing badly.\nMomentum is everything in a startup.  If you have momentum, you can survive most other problems.  If you do not have momentum, nothing except getting momentum will solve your problems.  Founders internalize this during YC; many seem to forget in the few years after YC.  Burnout seems to almost always affect founders whose startups are not doing well, and then becomes a downward spiral.  In fact, one of my top few startup commandments is “never let the company lose momentum”.\nThere are a few other common problems.  One is a feeling of “we made it” that comes after a big financing round and a reduction in intensity.  A related problem is that after you’ve raised a lot of money or become somewhat well-known, it’s harder to admit that things aren’t working and you need to change direction.  Also, very small startups can grow by sheer force of will, even with a bad product.  This stops working after a few months as the numbers get larger, and if you haven’t built something people love, you will not be able to continue growing.\nSo how can startups avoid this slump?  Work on real work.  Stay focused on building a product your users love and hitting your growth targets.  Try to have a board and peers who will make you hold yourself accountable—don’t lose the urgency that you developed during YC.  Keep sending updates on your traction to your investors and anyone else who will read them (in fact, we’re building some new software at YC to automate this for our startups in the hope that it prevent some of them from going off the rails).  Make the mistake of focusing too much on what matters most, not too little, and relentlessly protect your time from everything else.  Don’t ever let yourself feel like you’ve won before you have.  I still don’t think the Airbnb founders feel like they’ve won.  You have to keep up a high level of intensity for many, many years.\nMany YC startups learns these lessons after a year or two in the wilderness, but for some it’s too late and for all it’s a waste of time.\nThe best startups we fund keep on doing exactly what they did during YC.  This sounds so simple and so obvious, but in practice so few founders do it.\nThe good news is it’s doable with deliberate effort.  If every founder (YC and otherwise) did it, the number of successful startups would probably double."

[1] I am unsure how the\nmajority of the 21st century will be powered, but I’d like to help\nget things moving.\n\nAlthough a lot of people are working on solar, I don’t\nthink enough people are working on terrestrial-based atomic energy, which has\nmajor advantages when it comes to cost, density, and predictability.\n\nGiven the potential importance, I’m making an exception to\nmy normal policy of not joining YC boards for Helion Energy and UPower.  Both of these companies went through YC about\na year ago.  Helion is working on fusion\nand UPower is working on fission; I’ve looked at many companies working on both\nand think these are the two best.  I’ll\nbe the chairman of both companies and I’m also investing in the seed/A rounds\nfor both companies. [2] \n\nBoth companies hope to have a test reactor operating in a\nfew years, and both companies are hiring. \nIf you’re interested in working on this, please get in touch. \n\n[1] I’m unsure of is what the split between sun-generated\n(I’m just going to call it solar but I use it to include wind and biofuels) and\nterrestrial-generated will be.  There\nwill only be one cheapest source of energy, and history suggests whatever that\nis will be fairly dominant.  So it will\nprobably be 80/20 one way or the other.\n\n[2] I will save my thoughts about traditional technology\ninvestors being afraid to touch expensive, long-term, high-risk high-reward\nprojects for another time.  A lot of\npeople talk about the need to try new things that are hard but could have huge\nimpact; it’s important to not just talk about them but to act.  I think it’s easier for individual investors\nto do this than for venture funds, at least given how they are currently\nstructured.\n\nI don’t think investors are doing nearly enough to fund\natomic energy.  With the exception of\nChina, new fission development has effectively stopped and very few plants have\nbeen built in recent memory.  Fission has\nbeen a remarkably safe and effective power source while generating 11% of the\nworld’s electricity—the first time I saw the data on the safety data of fission\nenergy relative to other power sources, I thought there was an error. \n\nOn the fusion side, only about four US fusion companies\nhave raised venture capital in the past few decades.  The big government projects, like NIF and\nITER, unfortunately have the feel of peacetime big government projects."

        "正文": "﻿I turned 30 last week and a friend asked me if I'd figured out any life advice in the past decade worth passing on.  I'm somewhat hesitant to publish this because I think these lists usually seem hollow, but here is a cleaned up version of my answer:1) Never put your family, friends, or significant other low on your priority list.  Prefer a handful of truly close friends to a hundred acquaintances.  Don’t lose touch with old friends.  Occasionally stay up until the sun rises talking to people.  Have parties.2) Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it.  Make it count.  Time is extremely limited and goes by fast.  Do what makes you happy and fulfilled—few people get remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway.  Don’t do stuff that doesn’t make you happy (this happens most often when other people want you to do something).  Don’t spend time trying to maintain relationships with people you don’t like, and cut negative people out of your life.  Negativity is really bad.  Don’t let yourself make excuses for not doing the things you want to do.3) How to succeed: pick the right thing to do (this is critical and usually ignored), focus, believe in yourself (especially when others tell you it’s not going to work), develop personal connections with people that will help you, learn to identify talented people, and work hard.  It’s hard to identify what to work on because original thought is hard.4) On work: it’s difficult to do a great job on work you don’t care about.  And it’s hard to be totally happy/fulfilled in life if you don’t like what you do for your work.  Work very hard—a surprising number of people will be offended that you choose to work hard—but not so hard that the rest of your life passes you by.  Aim to be the best in the world at whatever you do professionally.  Even if you miss, you’ll probably end up in a pretty good place.  Figure out your own productivity system—don’t waste time being unorganized, working at suboptimal times, etc.  Don’t be afraid to take some career risks, especially early on.  Most people pick their career fairly randomly—really think hard about what you like, what fields are going to be successful, and try to talk to people in those fields.5) On money: Whether or not money can buy happiness, it can buy freedom, and that’s a big deal.  Also, lack of money is very stressful.  In almost all ways, having enough money so that you don’t stress about paying rent does more to change your wellbeing than having enough money to buy your own jet.  Making money is often more fun than spending it, though I personally have never regretted money I’ve spent on friends, new experiences, saving time, travel, and causes I believe in.6) Talk to people more.  Read more long content and less tweets.  Watch less TV.  Spend less time on the Internet.7) Don’t waste time.  Most people waste most of their time, especially in business.8) Don’t let yourself get pushed around.  As Paul Graham once said to me, “People can become formidable, but it’s hard to predict who”.  (There is a big difference between confident and arrogant.  Aim for the former, obviously.)9) Have clear goals for yourself every day, every year, and every decade. 10) However, as valuable as planning is, if a great opportunity comes along you should take it.  Don’t be afraid to do something slightly reckless.  One of the benefits of working hard is that good opportunities will come along, but it’s still up to you to jump on them when they do.11) Go out of your way to be around smart, interesting, ambitious people.  Work for them and hire them (in fact, one of the most satisfying parts of work is forging deep relationships with really good people).  Try to spend time with people who are either among the best in the world at what they do or extremely promising but totally unknown.  It really is true that you become an average of the people you spend the most time with.12) Minimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don’t really matter.  It’s hard to overstate how important this is, and how bad most people are at it.  Get rid of distractions in your life.  Develop very strong ways to avoid letting crap you don’t like doing pile up and take your mental cycles, especially in your work life.13) Keep your personal burn rate low.  This alone will give you a lot of opportunities in life.14) Summers are the best.15) Don’t worry so much.  Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem.  Most people are too risk-averse, and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths.16) Ask for what you want.  17) If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it.  Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do.  When in doubt, kiss the boy/girl.18) Exercise.  Eat well.  Sleep.  Get out into nature with some regularity.19) Go out of your way to help people.  Few things in life are as satisfying.  Be nice to strangers.  Be nice even when it doesn’t matter.20) Youth is a really great thing.  Don’t waste it.  In fact, in your 20s, I think it’s ok to take a “Give me financial discipline, but not just yet” attitude.  All the money in the world will never get back time that passed you by.21) Tell your parents you love them more often.  Go home and visit as often as you can.22) This too shall pass.23) Learn voraciously. 24) Do new things often.  This seems to be really important.  Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think.  Aim to do something big, new, and risky every year in your personal and professional life.25) Remember how intensely you loved your boyfriend/girlfriend when you were a teenager?  Love him/her that intensely now.  Remember how excited and happy you got about stuff as a kid?  Get that excited and happy now.26) Don’t screw people and don’t burn bridges.  Pick your battles carefully.27) Forgive people. 28) Don’t chase status.  Status without substance doesn’t work for long and is unfulfilling.29) Most things are ok in moderation.  Almost nothing is ok in extreme amounts.30) Existential angst is part of life.  It is particularly noticeable around major life events or just after major career milestones.  It seems to particularly affect smart, ambitious people.  I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don’t have to spend too much time thinking about this.  Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way; you are not alone.31) Be grateful and keep problems in perspective.  Don’t complain too much.  Don’t hate other people’s success (but remember that some people will hate your success, and you have to learn to ignore it). 32) Be a doer, not a talker.33) Given enough time, it is possible to adjust to almost anything, good or bad.  Humans are remarkable at this.34) Think for a few seconds before you act.  Think for a few minutes if you’re angry.35) Don’t judge other people too quickly.  You never know their whole story and why they did or didn’t do something.  Be empathetic.36) The days are long but the decades are short."

        "正文": "This is part two of a a two-part post—the first part is here.THE NEED FOR REGULATION\n\nAlthough there has been a lot of discussion about the dangers of machine\nintelligence recently, there hasn’t been much discussion about what we should\ntry to do to mitigate the threat. \n\nPart of the reason is that many people are almost proud of how\nstrongly they believe that the algorithms in their neurons will never be\nreplicated in silicon, and so they don’t believe it’s a potential threat.  Another part of it is that figuring out what\nto do about it is just very hard, and the more one thinks about it the less\npossible it seems.  And another part is\nthat superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is probably still decades away [1],\nand we have very pressing problems now.\n\nBut we will face this threat at some point, and we have a lot of work\nto do before it gets here.  So here is a\nsuggestion.\n\nThe US government, and all other governments, should regulate the\ndevelopment of SMI.  In an ideal world,\nregulation would slow down the bad guys and speed up the good guys—it seems\nlike what happens with the first SMI to be developed will be very important.\n\nAlthough my general belief is that technology is often over-regulated, I\nthink some regulation is a good thing, and I’d hate to live in a world with no\nregulation at all.  And I think it’s\ndefinitely a good thing when the survival of humanity is in question.  (Incidentally, there is precedent for classification of\nprivately-developed knowledge when it carries mass risk to human life.  SILEX is perhaps the best-known example.) \n\nTo state the obvious, one of the biggest challenges is that the US has\nbroken all trust with the tech community over the past couple of years.  We’d need a new agency to do this.\n\nI am sure that Internet commentators will say that everything I’m\nabout to propose is not nearly specific enough, which is definitely true.  I mean for this to be the beginning of a\nconversation, not the end of one.\n\nThe first serious dangers from SMI are likely to involve humans and SMI\nworking together.  Regulation should\naddress both the case of malevolent humans intentionally misusing machine\nintelligence to, for example, wreak havoc on worldwide financial markets or air\ntraffic control systems, and the “accident” case of SMI being developed and\nthen acting unpredictably.\n\nSpecifically, regulation should: \n\n1)   Provide a\nframework to observe progress.  This\nshould happen in two ways.  The first is\nlooking for places in the world where it seems like a group is either being\naided by significant machine intelligence or training such an intelligence in\nsome way. \n\nThe second\nis observing companies working on SMI development.  The companies shouldn’t have to disclose how\nthey’re doing what they’re doing (though when governments gets serious about\nSMI they are likely to out-resource any private company), but periodically\nshowing regulators their current capabilities seems like a smart idea.\n\n2)   Given how\ndisastrous a bug could be, require development safeguards to reduce the risk of\nthe accident case.  For example, beyond a\ncertain checkpoint, we could require development happen only on airgapped\ncomputers, require that self-improving software require human intervention to\nmove forward on each iteration, require that certain parts of the software be\nsubject to third-party code reviews, etc. \nI’m not very optimistic than any of this will work for anything except\naccidental errors—humans will always be the weak link in the strategy (see the\nAI-in-a-box thought experiments).  But it\nat least feels worth trying.\n\nBeing able\nto do this—if it is possible at all—will require a huge amount of technical\nresearch and development that we should start intensive work on now.  This work is almost entirely separate from\nthe work that’s happening today to get piecemeal machine intelligence to work.\n\nTo state\nthe obvious but important point, it’s important to write the regulations in\nsuch a way that they provide protection while producing minimal drag on\ninnovation (though there will be some unavoidable cost).\n\n3)   Require\nthat the first SMI developed have as part of its operating rules that a) it\ncan’t cause any direct or indirect harm to humanity (i.e. Asimov’s zeroeth\nlaw), b) it should detect other SMI being developed but take no action beyond\ndetection, c) other than required for part b, have no effect on the world.\n\nWe\ncurrently don’t know how to implement any of this, so here too, we need\nsignificant technical research and development that we should start now. \n\n4)   Provide lots\nof funding for R+D for groups that comply with all of this, especially for\ngroups doing safety research.\n\n5)   Provide a\nlonger-term framework for how we figure out a safe and happy future for\ncoexisting with SMI—the most optimistic version seems like some version of “the\nhuman/machine merge”.  We don’t have to\nfigure this out today.\n\nRegulation would have an effect on SMI development via financing—most\nventure firms and large technology companies don’t want to break major laws.  Most venture-backed startups and large\ncompanies would presumably comply with the regulations.\n\nAlthough it’s possible that a lone wolf in a garage will be the one to\nfigure SMI out, it seems more likely that it will be a group of very smart\npeople with a lot of resources.  It also\nseems likely, at least given the current work I’m aware of, it will involve US\ncompanies in some way (though, as I said above, I think every government in the\nworld should enact similar regulations).\n\nSome people worry that regulation will slow down progress in the US\nand ensure that SMI gets developed somewhere else first.  I don’t think a little bit of regulation is\nlikely to overcome the huge head start and density of talent that US companies\ncurrently have.\n\nThere is an obvious upside case to SMI —it could solve a lot of the\nserious problems facing humanity—but in my opinion it is not the default case.  The other big upside case is that machine\nintelligence could help us figure out how to upload ourselves, and we could\nlive forever in computers.  Or maybe in\nsome way, we can make SMI be a descendent of humanity.\n\nGenerally, the arc of technology has been about reducing randomness\nand increasing our control over the world. \nAt some point in the next century, we are going to have the most\nrandomness ever injected into the system. \n\nIn politics, we usually fight over small differences.  These differences pale in comparison to the\ndifference between humans and aliens, which is what SMI will effectively be\nlike.  We should be able to come together\nand figure out a regulatory strategy quickly.\n\nThanks to Dario Amodei\n(especially Dario), Paul Buchheit, Matt Bush, Patrick Collison, Holden\nKarnofsky, Luke Muehlhauser, and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts of this and\nthe previous post. \n\n[1] If you want to try to\nguess when, the two things I’d think about are computational power and\nalgorithmic development.  For the former,\nassume there are about 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses in a human\nbrain, and the average neuron fires 5 times per second, and then think about\nhow long it will take on the current computing trajectory to get a machine with\nenough memory and flops to simulate that. \n\nFor the algorithms, neural\nnetworks and reinforcement learning have both performed better than I’ve expected\nfor input and output respectively (e.g. captioning photos depicting complex\nscenes, beating humans at video games the software has never seen before with\njust the ability to look at the screen and access to the controls).  I am always surprised how unimpressed most\npeople seem with these results. \nUnsupervised learning has been a weaker point, and this is probably a\ncritical part of replicating human intelligence.   But many researchers I’ve spoken to are\noptimistic about current work, and I have no reason to believe this is outside\nthe scope of a Turing machine."

        "正文": "This is going to be a two-part post—one on why machine intelligence is something we\nshould be afraid of, and one on what we should do about it.  If you’re already afraid of machine intelligence, you can skip\nthis one and read the second post tomorrow—I was planning to only write part 2,\nbut when I asked a few people to read drafts it became clear I needed part 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD FEAR MACHINE INTELLIGENCE\n\nDevelopment of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) [1] is\nprobably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.  There are other threats that I think are more\ncertain to happen (for example, an engineered virus with a long incubation\nperiod and a high mortality rate) but are unlikely to destroy every human in\nthe universe in the way that SMI could. \nAlso, most of these other big threats are already widely feared.\n\nIt is extremely hard to put a timeframe on when this will happen (more\non this later), and it certainly feels to most people working in the field that it’s\nstill many, many years away.  But it’s\nalso extremely hard to believe that it isn’t very likely that it will happen at\nsome point.\n\nSMI does not have to be the inherently evil sci-fi version to kill us\nall.  A more probable scenario is that it\nsimply doesn’t care about us much either way, but in an effort to accomplish\nsome other goal (most goals, if you think about them long enough, could make\nuse of resources currently being used by humans) wipes us out.  Certain goals, like self-preservation, could\nclearly benefit from no humans.  We wash\nour hands not because we actively wish ill towards the bacteria and viruses on\nthem, but because we don’t want them to get in the way of our plans.\n\n(Incidentally, Nick Bostrom’s excellent book “Superintelligence” is\nthe best thing I’ve seen on this topic. \nIt is well worth a read.)\n\nMost machine intelligence development involves a “fitness function”—something the\nprogram tries to optimize.  At some\npoint, someone will probably try to give a program the fitness function of\n“survive and reproduce”.  Even if not, it will likely be a useful subgoal of\nmany other fitness functions.  It worked\nwell for biological life.  Unfortunately for us, one thing I\nlearned when I was a student in the Stanford AI lab is that programs often achieve\ntheir fitness function in unpredicted ways.\n\nEvolution will continue forward, and if humans are no longer the\nmost-fit species, we may go away.  In some sense, this is the system\nworking as designed.  But as a human programmed to survive and reproduce,\nI feel we should fight it.\n\nHow\ncan we survive the development of SMI?  It may not be possible.  One\nof my top 4 favorite explanations for the Fermi paradox is that biological\nintelligence always eventually creates machine intelligence, which wipes out\nbiological life and then for some reason decides to makes itself undetectable.\n\nIt’s very hard to know how close we are to machine intelligence\nsurpassing human intelligence. \nProgression of machine intelligence is a double exponential function; human-written\nprograms and computing power are getting better at an exponential rate, and\nself-learning/self-improving software will improve itself at an exponential\nrate.  Development progress may look\nrelatively slow and then all of a sudden go vertical—things could get out of\ncontrol very quickly (it also may be more gradual and we may barely perceive it\nhappening).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is probably still somewhat far away, especially\nin its ability to build killer robots with no help at all from humans.  But recursive self-improvement is a powerful\nforce, and so it’s difficult to have strong opinions about machine intelligence being ten or one hundred years away.\n\nWe also have a bad habit of changing the definition of machine intelligence when a\nprogram gets really good to claim that the problem wasn’t really that hard in\nthe first place (chess, Jeopardy, self-driving cars, etc.).  This makes it seems like we aren’t making any\nprogress towards it.  Admittedly, narrow\nmachine intelligence is very different than general-purpose machine intelligence, but I still think this is a\npotential blindspot.\n\nIt’s hard to look at the rate or improvement in the last 40 years and\nthink that 40 years for now we’re not going to be somewhere crazy.  40 years ago we had Pong.  Today we have virtual reality so advanced\nthat it’s difficult to be sure if it’s virtual or real, and computers that can\nbeat humans in most games.\n\nThough, to be fair, in the last 40 years we have made little progress on the parts of machine intelligence that seem really hard—learning, creativity, etc.  Basic search with a lot of compute power has\njust worked better than expected. \n\nOne additional reason that progress towards SMI is difficult to\nquantify is that emergent behavior is always a challenge for intuition.  The above common criticism of current machine intelligence—that\nno one has produced anything close to human creativity, and that this is\nsomehow inextricably linked with any sort of real intelligence—causes a lot of\nsmart people to think that SMI must be very far away.\n\nBut it’s very possible that creativity and what we think of us as\nhuman intelligence are just an emergent property of a small number of\nalgorithms operating with a lot of compute power (In fact, many respected\nneocortex researchers believe there is effectively one algorithm for all\nintelligence.  I distinctly remember my\nundergrad advisor saying the reason he was excited about machine intelligence again was that\nbrain research made it seem possible there was only one algorithm computer scientists\nhad to figure out.)\n\nBecause we don’t understand how human intelligence works in any\nmeaningful way, it’s difficult to make strong statements about how close or far\naway from emulating it we really are.  We\ncould be completely off track, or we could be one algorithm away.\n\nHuman brains don’t look all that different from chimp brains, and yet\nsomehow produce wildly different capabilities. \nWe decry current machine intelligence as cheap tricks, but perhaps our own intelligence is\njust the emergent combination of a bunch of cheap tricks.\n\nMany people seem to believe that SMI would be very dangerous if it\nwere developed, but think that it’s either never going to happen or definitely very far\noff.   This is sloppy, dangerous\nthinking.[1] I prefer calling it \"machine intelligence\" and not \"artificial intelligence\" because artificial seems to imply it's not real or not very good.  When it gets developed, there will be nothing artificial about it."

if you don’t,\nnothing else will save you.\n\nOnce you’ve shifted from “interesting project” to “company”\nmode, be decisive and act quickly.  Instead\nof thinking about making a decision over the course of week, think about making\nit in an hour, and getting it done in the next hour.\n\nBecome formidable. \nAlso become tough—the road ahead is going to be painful and make you\ndoubt yourself many, many times.\n\nFigure out a way to get your product in front of users.  Start manually (read this: http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html)\n\nListen to what your users tell you, improve your product,\nand then listen again.  Keep doing this until\nyou’ve made something some users love (one of the many brilliant Paul Buchheit\nobservations is that it’s better to build something a small number of users\nlove than something a lot of users like). \nDon’t deceive yourself about whether or not your users actually love\nyour product.\n\nKeep your burn rate very low until you’re sure you’ve built\nsomething people love.  The easiest way\nto do this is hire slowly.\n\nHave a strategy.  Most\npeople don’t.  Occasionally take a little\nbit of time to think about how you’re executing against your strategy.  Specifically, remember that someday you need\nto have a monopoly (in the Peter Thiel sense).\n\nRead this before you raise money: http://paulgraham.com/fr.html.\n\nLearn to ask for what you want. \n\nIgnore what the press says about you, especially if it’s\ncomplimentary.\n\nGenerate revenue early in the life of your company.\n\nHire the best people you can.  However much time you’re spending on this,\nit’s probably not enough.  Give a lot of\nequity to your employees, and have very high expectations.  Smart, effective people are critical to\nsuccess.  Read this: http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire.\n\nFire people quickly when you make hiring mistakes.\n\nDon’t work with people you don’t have a good feeling\nabout—this goes for employees (and cofounders), partners, investors, etc.\n\nFigure out a way to get users at scale (i.e. bite the bullet\nand learn how sales and marketing work). \nIncidentally, while it is currently in fashion, spending more than the\nlifetime value of your users to acquire them is not an acceptable strategy.\n\nObsess about your growth rate, and never stop.   The company will build what the CEO\nmeasures.  If you ever catch yourself\nsaying “we’re not really focused on growth right now”, think very carefully\nabout the possibility you’re focused on the wrong thing.  Also, don’t let yourself be deceived by\nvanity metrics.\n\nEventually, the company needs to evolve to become a mission\nthat everyone, but especially the founders, are exceptionally dedicated\nto.  The “missionaries vs. mercenaries”\nsoundbite is overused but true.\n\nDon’t waste your time on stuff that doesn’t matter (i.e.\nthings other than building your product, talking to your users, growing,\netc.).  In general, avoid the kind of\nstuff that might be in a movie about running a startup—meeting with lawyers and\naccountants, going to lots of conferences, grabbing coffee with people, sitting\nin lots of meetings, etc.  Become a Delaware\nC Corp (use Clerky or any well-known Silicon Valley law firm) and then get back\nto work on your product.\n\nFocus intensely on the things that do matter.  Every day, figure out what the 2 or 3 most\nimportant things for you to do are.  Do\nthose and ignore other distractions.  Be\na relentless execution machine.\n\nDo what it takes and don’t make up excuses.\n\nLearn to manage people. \nMake sure your employees are happy. \nDon’t ignore this.\n\nIn addition to building a great product, if you want to be\nreally successful, you also have to build a great company.  So think a lot about your culture.\n\nDon’t underestimate the importance of personal connections.\n\nIgnore acquisition interest until you are sure you want to\nsell.  Don’t “check the market”.  There is an alternate universe somewhere full\nof companies that would have been great if they could have just avoided this\none mistake.  Unfortunately, in this\nuniverse, they’re all dead.\n\nWork really hard. \nEveryone wants a secret to success other than this;

        "正文": "In human history, there have been three great technological revolutions\nand many smaller ones.  The three great\nones are the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, and the one we\nare now in the middle of—the software revolution. [1]\n\nThe great technological revolutions have affected what most\npeople do every day and how society is structured.  The previous one, the industrial revolution, created\nlots of jobs because the new technology required huge numbers of humans to run\nit.  But this is not the normal course of\ntechnology; it was an anomaly in that sense. \nAnd it makes people think, perhaps subconsciously, that technological\nrevolutions are always good for most people’s personal economic status.\n\nIt appears that the software revolution will do what\ntechnology usually does—create wealth but destroy jobs.  Of course, we will probably find new things\nto do to satisfy limitless human demand. \nBut we should stop pretending that the software revolution, by itself,\nis going to be good for median wages.\n\nTechnology provides leverage on ability and luck, and in the\nprocess concentrates wealth and drives inequality.  I think that drastic wealth inequality is\nlikely to be one of the biggest social problems of the next 20 years. [2] We\ncan—and we will—redistribute wealth, but it still doesn’t solve the real\nproblem of people needing something fulfilling to do.\n\nTrying to hold on to worthless jobs is a terrible but\npopular idea.  Trying to find new jobs\nfor billions of people is a good idea but obviously very hard because whatever\nthe new jobs are, they will probably be so fundamentally different from\nanything that exists today that meaningful planning is almost impossible.  But the current strategy—“let’s just pretend\nthat Travis is kidding when he talks about self-driving cars and that Uber\nreally is going to create millions of jobs forever”—is not the right answer.\n\nThe second major challenge of the software revolution is the\nconcentration of power in small groups. \nThis also happens with most technological revolutions, but the last\ntruly terrifying technology (the atomic bomb) taught us bad lessons in a\nsimilar way to the industrial revolution and job growth.\n\nIt is hard to make an atomic bomb not because the knowledge\nis restricted (though it is—if I, hypothetically, knew how to make an atomic\nbomb, it would be tremendously illegal for me to say anything about it) but\nbecause it takes huge amounts of energy to enrich Uranium.  One effectively needs the resources of\nnations to do it. [3]\n\nAgain, this is not the normal course for technology—it was\nan idiosyncrasy of nuclear development. \nThe software revolution is likely to do what technology usually does,\nand make more power available to small groups.\n\nTwo of the biggest risks I see emerging from the software\nrevolution—AI and synthetic biology—may put tremendous capability to cause harm\nin the hands of small groups, or even individuals.  It is probably already possible to design and\nproduce a terrible disease in a small lab; development of an AI that could end\nhuman life may only require a few hundred people in an office building anywhere\nin the world, with no equipment other than laptops. \n\nThe new existential threats won’t require the resources of\nnations to produce.  A number of things\nthat used to take the resources of nations—building a rocket, for example—are\nnow doable by companies, at least partially enabled by software.  But a rocket can destroy anything on earth.\n\nWhat can we do?  We\ncan’t make the knowledge of these things illegal and hope it will work.  We can’t try to stop technological progress.\n\nI think the best strategy is to try to legislate sensible\nsafeguards but work very hard to make sure the edge we get from technology on\nthe good side is stronger than the edge that bad actors get.  If we can synthesize new diseases, maybe we can synthesize vaccines.  If we can\nmake a bad AI, maybe we can make a good AI that stops the bad one.\n\nThe current strategy is badly misguided.  It’s not going to be like the atomic bomb\nthis time around, and the sooner we stop pretending otherwise, the better off\nwe’ll be.  The fact that we don’t have\nserious efforts underway to combat threats from synthetic biology and AI\ndevelopment is astonishing.\n\nTo be clear, I’m a fan of the software revolution and I feel\nfortunate I was born when I was.  But I\nworry we learned the wrong lessons from recent examples, and these two issues—huge-scale\ndestruction of jobs, and concentration of huge power—are getting lost.\n\n \n\n \n\n[1] A\nlot of the smaller ones have been very important, like the hand axe\n(incidentally, the hand axe is the longest-serving piece of technology in human\nhistory), writing, cannons, the internal combustion engine, atomic bombs,\nfishing (many people believe that fishing is what allowed us to develop the\nbrains that we have now), and many more. \n\n[2] It is true that life is better in an absolute sense than\nit was a hundred years ago even for very poor people.  Most of the stuff that people defending\ncurrent levels of wealth inequality say is also true—highly paid people do indeed\nmake inexpensive services for poor people.\n\nHowever, ignoring quality of life relative to other people\nalive today feels like it ignores what make us human.  I think it’s a good thing when some people\nmake thousands of times as much money as what other people make, but I also\ndon’t resent paying my taxes and think we should do much more to help people\nthat are actually poor.  The social\nsafety net will have to trend up with the development of technology. \n\n[3] Or at least, one used to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_isotopes_by_laser_excitation"

        "正文": "The most important story of 2014 that most people ignored was the Chinese economy overtaking the US economy.  (This is using the purchasing power parity metric, which incorporates differences in the price of goods, but the Chinese economy will overtake on other metrics soon enough.)This shouldn’t have caught anyone by surprise; US growth has stagnated while Chinese growth has continued to do pretty well (the chart below shows inflation-adjusted economic growth rates in China vs. the US since 1978).  The US has become less competitive globally—for example, other countries have surpassed our education system, and we have structural and demographic challenges other countries don’t and that create significant expenses.        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \nThe historical track record of the largest economy being overtaken by another is not good.  Sometimes it’s violent.  (For example, Germany and the UK in 1914.  Though neither were the largest in the world, the world was less globalized.  They were the largest in the region and very focused on each other.)  Sometimes it’s a long, slow slide of denial into stagnation and decreasing relevance.It’s almost unthinkable for most people born in the US in the last 70 or so years for the US not to be the world’s superpower.  But on current trajectories, we’re about to find out what that looks like. [1] The current plan seems to be something like “managed decline”, or gradual acceptance of reduced importance.The US gets huge advantages from being the world’s largest economy (as mentioned earlier, other countries wanting this sometimes leads to major conflict).  For example, our currency is the most important currency in the world, and we can do things like run a trillion dollar deficit without anyone getting too concerned.  People generally have to buy energy (oil) in our currency, which adds a great deal of support (though we’ve already seen the very beginnings of the PetroYuan).  Also, we get to have the world’s most powerful army.The current business model of the US requires the dollar to be the world reserve currency, though the Chinese currency is rapidly becoming a viable alternative. At some point, China will relax its currency controls, allowing trade and offshore investment to grow rapidly.  The Renminbi (RMB) will probably rise in value (though some people think the opposite will happen in the short term) and China will become an important financial center.The most critical question, speaking as a hopeful US citizen, is whether or not it’s possible for one country to remain as powerful as another with four times less people.  The US has never been the world’s largest country by population, but it has been the largest economy, and so it’s clearly possible for at least some period of time.How has the US done this?  One important way has been our excellence in innovation and developing new technology.  A remarkable number of the major technological developments—far in excess of our share of the world’s population—have come from the US in the last century.The secret to this is not genetics or something in our drinking water.  We’ve had an environment that encourages investment, welcomes immigrants, rewards risk-taking, hard work [2], and radical thinking, and minimizes impediments to doing new things.  Unfortunately we’ve moved somewhat away from this.  Our best hope, by far, is to find a way to return to it quickly.   Although the changes required to become more competitive will likely be painful, and probably even produce a short-term economic headwind, they are critical to make.The US should try very hard to find a way to grow faster.  [3] I’ve written about this in the past.  Even if there weren’t a competitor in the picture, countries historically don’t do well with declining growth, and so it’s in our interest to try to continue to keep growth up.  It’s our standard advice to startups, and it works for organizations at all levels.  Things are either growing or dying.The other thing to try to do is figure out a way to coexist with China.  Absent some major surprise, China and the US are going to be the world superpowers for some time.  The world is now so interconnected that totally separate governments playing by different rules are not going to work (for example, if people can manufacture goods in China without regard for environmental regulations, they’ll be cheaper than US goods, but they’ll harm the environment for people in the US eventually).  Instead of the normal historical path of increasing two-way animosity until it erupts in conflict, maybe we can find a way to both work on what we’re really good at and have governments that at least partially cooperate. Thanks to Patrick Collison, Matt Danzeisen (especially to Matt, who provided major help), Paul Graham, and Alfred Lin for reading drafts of this.[1] As a related sidenote, “exceptionalism” in the US has become almost a bad word—it’s bad to talk about an individual being exceptionally good, and certainly bad to talk about the country as a whole being exceptional.  On my last visit to China, the contrast here was remarkable—people loved talking about how amazing certain entrepreneurs were, and the work the country as a whole was doing to make itself the best in the world.The other stark contrast is how much harder people in China seem to work than people here, and how working hard is considered a good thing, not a bad thing.[2] One thing that I’ve found puzzling over the last ten or so years is the anger directed towards people who choose to work hard.  This is almost never from actually poor people who work two minimum wage jobs (who work harder than all the rest of us, pretty much) but from middle class people.  It’s often somewhat subtle—“It’s so stupid that these people play the startup lottery.  What idiots.  They should just consult.” or “Startups need to stop glorifying young workers that can work all day and night”—but the message is clear.  My explanation is that this is simply what happens in a low-growth, zero-sum environment.[3] A significant and relevant headwind for US growth is that current US policy often encourages investment and job growth outside the US; domestic companies can borrow at low rates because of 0% Fed lending, build factories (and create jobs) in other countries, and then hold/reinvest those profits offshore rather than pay high taxes repatriating their funds."

        "正文": "I get asked fairly often now by people in the\nUS government what policy changes I would make to “fix innovation and drive\neconomic growth” [1][2] (for some reason, it’s almost always that exact\nphrase).\n\nInnovation is obviously important—the US has\nlong been the world’s best exporter of new ideas, and it’d be disastrously bad\nif that were no longer the case.  Also, I don’t think our society will\nwork very well without economic growth, and innovation is what will\ndrive growth from where we are now.  While it’s true that people are\nbetter off in absolute sense than they were a few hundred years ago, most of us\nare more sensitive to our wealth increasing over short time-scales (i.e. life\ngetting better every year) than how fortunate we are relative to people who\nlived a long time ago. [3]  Democracy works well in a society with lots of\ngrowth, but not a no-growth (i.e. zero-sum) society.  Very low growth and a democracy are a very bad\ncombination.\n\nSo here is my answer:\n\n1) Fix education.  We have to fix education in this country.  Yes, it\nwill take a long time to have an effect on output, but that’s not an excuse for\ncontinuing not to take serious action.  We currently spend about 4% of the\nfederal budget on education.  The problems with education are well-documented—teachers\nmake far too little, it’s too difficult to fire bad teachers, some cultures\ndon’t value education, etc.  Many of these are easy to fix—pay teachers a\nlot more in exchange for a change in the tenure rules, for example—and some\nissues (like cultural ones) are probably going to be very difficult to fix.\n\nWithout good education (including continuing\neducation and re-training for older people), we will never have equality of\nopportunity.  And we will never have enough innovators.\n\nI think it’s most important to fix the broken\nparts of the current system, but also to decide we need to spend more money on education.\n\nOne bright spot is that most of the world now\nhas Internet access at least some of the time and there are truly remarkable\nresources available online to learn pretty much anything anyone could want. \nIt amazes me that I can become relatively proficient on any subject I want, for\nfree, from a $50 smartphone nearly anywhere in the world.  There is\nprobably a way to combine online education with real-world mentorship,\nactivity, and group interaction in a way that makes the cost of quality\neducation far lower than it is today.\n\nSpending money on education, unlike most\ngovernment spending, actually has an ROI—every dollar we spend on it ought to\nreturn more dollars in the future.  This is the sort of budget item that\npeople should be able to agree on.  As I\nwrote in the above-linked post, we will likely need both entitlement spending reductions\nand revenue increases to make the budget work.\n\n2) Invest in basic research\nand development.  Government\nspending on R&D keeps decreasing.  There are certain things that\ncompanies are really good at doing; basic research is usually not one of\nthem.  If the government wants more innovation, then it should stop\ncutting the amount of money it spends producing it.  I think current policy is off by something\nlike an order of magnitude here.\n\nLike education, this is in the category of an\n“investment”, not an “expense”.\n\n3) Reform immigration.  If talented people want to come start companies or\ndevelop new technologies in the US, we should let them.  Turning them away—willfully\nsending promising new companies to other countries—seems terribly\nshortsighted.  This will have an immediate positive effect on innovation\nand GDP growth.  Aside from the obvious\nand well-documented economic benefits (for high-skilled workers especially, but\nfor immigration more generally), it’s a matter of justice—I don’t think I\ndeserve special rights because I happened to be born here, and I think it’s\nunfair to discriminate on country of birth.  Other than Native Americans,\nall of our families are fairly recent immigrants.\n\nWe need reasonable limits, of course, but our current limits are\nnot the answer.  On our current path, in the not-very-distant future, we\nwill be begging the people we are currently turning away to come and create\nvalue in the US. \n\nMany people say we don’t need immigration\nreform because people can work remotely.  While remote working works well\nfor a lot of companies, and I expect it to continue to work better as time goes\non, it doesn’t work well for all companies (for example, it would not work for\nYC), and it shouldn’t be the only option.  It also sends money and\ncompetency out of our economy.  The common answer of “let the US companies\nopen overseas offices” always sounds to me like “further slow US economic\ngrowth and long-term viability”.\n\nCompanies in the Bay Area already largely hire from elsewhere in\ncountry—companies are desperate for talented people, and there aren’t enough\nhere to go around.  Even with this, tech wages keep going up, and good\npeople who already live in the Bay Area keep getting jobs.\n\n4) Cheaper\nhousing.  This is not a problem\neverywhere in the US, but it is in a lot of places.  The cost of housing\nin SF and the Bay Area in general is horrific.  There just isn’t enough housing\nhere, and so it’s really expensive (obviously, many people make the rational\ndecision not to live here).  Expensive housing drives up the cost of\neverything else, and a lower cost of living gives people more flexibility\n(which will hopefully lead to more innovation) and more disposable income\n(which will hopefully stimulate economic growth).\n\nHomeowners generally vote and want to preserve\ntheir property value; non-homeowners generally vote less often.  So\nefforts to build more housing, or make housing less attractive as an\ninvestment, usually fail when they go to a vote.  For example, a recent proposal to allow more\nhouse building in SF failed with an atrociously low voter turnout.\n\nIn general, I think policy should discourage\nspeculation on real estate and encourage housing to be as inexpensive as\npossible.  I think most people would do better owning assets that drive\ngrowth anyway.\n\nIn the Bay Area specifically, I think policy\nshould target an aggressive increase in the housing supply in the next 5 years\nand undo many of the regulations currently preventing this.\n\n5) Reduce regulation.  I think some regulation is a good thing.  In certain areas\n(like development of AI) I’d like to see a lot more of it.  But I think it\noften goes too far—for example, an average of $2.5B and 10 years to bring a new\ndrug to market strikes me as problematic.\n\nMany of the companies I know that are innovating in the physical\nworld struggle with regulatory challenges.  And they’re starting to\nleave.  The biggest problem, usually, is that they just can’t get clarity\nout of the massive and slow government bureaucracy.  In 2014, 4\ncompanies that I work with chose to at least partially leave the US for more\nfriendly regulatory environments (3 for regulatory violation or uncertainty,\nand 1 for concern about export restrictions).  Many more kept their\nheadquarters here but chose somewhere else as their initial market (including,\nfor example, nearly all medical device companies, but also drone companies,\nnuclear fission companies, pharmaceutical companies, bitcoin companies, etc etc\netc).\n\nThis is not good.  We live in a global\nsociety now, and not all countries are as backward about immigration as we are. \nIf our best and brightest want to go start companies elsewhere, they will do\nso. [4] \n\nI think one interesting way to solve this\nwould be with incentives.  Right now, as\nI understand it, regulators mostly get “career advancement” by saying “no” to\nthings.  Though it would take a lot of\ncareful thought, it might produce good results if regulators were compensated\nwith some version of equity in what they regulate.\n\nAgain, I think some regulation is definitely\ngood.  But the current situation is stifling innovation.\n\n6) Make\nbeing a public company not be so terrible. \nThis point is related to the one above. \nI’d hate to run a public company. \nPublic companies end up with a bunch of short-term stockholders who\nsimultaneously criticize you for missing earnings by a penny this quarter and\nnot making enough long-term investments.\n\nMost companies stop innovating when they go\npublic, because they need very predictable revenue and expenses.\n\nIn an ideal world, CEOs would ignore this sort\nof pressure and make long-term bets.  But\nthe inanity on CNBC is distracting in all sorts of ways—for example, it’s\nalways surprising to me how much employees react to what they hear about their\ncompany on the news.\n\nI’ve seen CEOs do the wrong thing because they\nwere scared of how “the market might react” if they do the right thing.  It’s a rare CEO (such as Zuckerberg, Page,\nCook, and Bezos) who can stand up to public market investors and make the sort\nof bets that will produce long term innovation and growth at the expense of\nshort term profits.\n\nThere are a lot of changes I’d make to improve\nthe situation.  One easy one is that I’d\npay public company directors in all stock and not let them sell it for 5\nyears.  That will produce a focus on real\ngrowth (in the current situation, making $200k a year for four days of work\nleads to directors focusing on preserving their own jobs).\n\nAnother is that I’d encourage exchanges that\ndon’t trade every millisecond.  Liquidity\nis a good thing; I personally don’t see the value in the level of “fluidity”\nthat we have.  It’s distracting to the\ncompanies and sucks up an enormous amount of human attention (one of the things\nI like about investing in startups is that I only have to think about the price\nonce every 18 months or so).  If I had to\ntake a company public, I’d love to only have my shares priced and traded once\nevery month of quarter.\n\nA third change would be something to incent\npeople to hold shares for long periods of time. \nOne way to do this would be charge a decent-sized fee on every share\ntraded (and have the fee go to the company); another would be a graduated tax\nrate that goes from something like 80% for day trades down to 10% for shares\nheld for 5 years. \n\nAnother thing the government could do is just\nmake it much easier to stay private for a long time, though this would have\nundesirable side effects (especially around increasing wealth inequality).\n\n7) Target a real GDP growth\nrate.  You build what you measure.  If\nthe government wants more growth, set a target and focus everyone on hitting\nit.\n\nGDP is not a perfect metric, especially as the software revolution drives cost of goods gets driven lower and lower.  What we really need is a measurement of “total quality of life”.  This will be tough to figure out, but it’s probably worth the time to invent some framework and then measure ourselves against itThere are obviously a lot of other policy changes I think we should make, but on the topics of growth and innovation, these 7 points are what I think are most important.  And I’m confident that if we don’t take action here, we are going to regret it.\n\n[1] Incidentally, innovation does not always\ndrive job growth, even when it drives GDP growth.  The industrial\nrevolution was something of an anomaly in this regard.  I’ll write more\nabout what this means later.\n\n[2] There are a bunch of other policy changes\nI would make—for example, I’d increase the minimum wage to something like $15\nan hour—that are important and somewhat related to this goal but not directly\nrelated enough to include here.\n\n[3] While access to knowledge, healthcare,\nfood, water, etc. for people in developed countries is far better now than any\ntime in history, extreme inequality still feels unfair (I’ll save my social\nrant for another time, but I think the level of extreme poverty that still\nexists in the world is absolutely atrocious. \nTraveling around the developing world is an incredible wake-up call.) \n\n[4] Sometimes the government people ask “Would\nyou ever move YC out of the US?” with nervous laughter?  I really like it\nhere and I sure hope we don’t, but never say never.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "正文": "I wrote this for the FT, but it's behind a paywall.  Since I wrote it, I feel like it's probably ok for me to post it here.The natural state of a start-up is to die; most start-ups require multiple miracles in their early days to escape this fate. But the density and breadth of the Silicon Valley network does sometimes let start-ups cheat death.Silicon Valley works because there is such a high density of people working on start-ups and they are inclined to help each other. Other tech hubs have this as well but this is a case of Metcalfe’s law – the utility of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes on the network. Silicon Valley has far more nodes in the network than anywhere else.One of the biggest misconceptions about us is that you need to have pre-existing connections to get value from the network. Remarkably, you don’t. Silicon Valley is a community of outsiders that have come together. If you build something good, people will help you. It’s standard practice to ask people you’ve just met for help – and as long as you aren’t annoying about it, they usually don’t mind.I run Y Combinator, an investment firm that gives a small amount of money and a lot of advice to a large number of start-ups. We do this in batches twice a year. Our network works because it has very strong connections. Founders are generally closer to their earliest investors and less close to their later investors. They are closest of all to the peers they were around when struggling to get their start. Therefore, YC founders are typically willing to do anything they can to help another YC founder. Sometimes this is being a customer or investing, sometimes it’s referring a candidate, sometimes it’s advice and investor connections. Often it’s just moral support.I often ask founders what surprised them most about going through YC, and a common answer is the degree to which YC is a “meta-company”. Yes, the approximately 700 YC companies are all totally independent legal entities – but the connection is so strong that alumni companies get significant benefits from each other. Most YC founders tell us they get more help from other YC founders than all other friends of the company, advisors and investors put together. Most will try a product from another YC company before deciding to use one outside the network.This seems like the future to me – large groups of independent companies, loosely tied together.One question I get asked a lot is how to replicate the success of Silicon Valley elsewhere. Most people realise that the world of start-ups benefits tremendously from network effects, and think it sounds impossible to replicate the necessary density anywhere else. But my experience suggests it’s probably doable with a few thousand people and a reasonable amount of capital.I think you need two other things: an area where many ambitious people care most about start-ups and technology, and a focus on long-term compensation. In most cities, there’s one field that dominates the conversation – finance in New York, politics in DC, movies in LA and start-ups in San Francisco. If start-ups are second fiddle, it will be challenging to replicate the environment of Silicon Valley.The focus in Silicon Valley on long-term compensation is also important. Nearly everyone wants to get rich but they’re willing to wait to do so. Conspicuous consumption isn’t that cool; not too many people drive Ferraris or talk about their vacation homes. Unlike other cities where people are mostly focused on cash compensation for this year, in Silicon Valley more people talk about equity than salaries (assuming, of course, that they can afford the wildly-out-of-control housing costs, which is probably the biggest weakness here right now). A focus on making a lot of money in the long term at the expense of short-term opportunities is essential to building companies that have a huge impact – they take a long time."

(It’s probably different for\nA and B rounds because the best companies often have exponential growth at that\npoint.)  The hotly-competed seed\ninvestments I’ve made have underperformed. \n\nFor all of the really good seed investments I’ve made, other\ninvestors I respected thought they were bad ideas.  Stripe started before it was cool for very\nyoung founders to take on very established industries, and the prevailing\nthoughts from people I asked about were that it was never going to work (the\ninitial plan was to be a bank) because Patrick knew nothing about the\nindustry.  Teespring got passed on by\nmost investors, saying “It’s just a t-shirt company.”\n\nRight before I invested in Zenefits, a prominent investor\ntold me I didn’t understand the health insurance market at all and that the\ncompany was unlikely to survive another 3 months.  When I made this investment, the company was\nworried about imminently running out of cash. \nI almost got talked out of investing by the other investor.\n\nThe one major exception is Optimizely—the prevailing\nsentiment was that Optimizely was going to be great, and it was a competitive\nseed round.  It was the only high-return\ncompany where I had to fight for an allocation—in the other four, I could have\nput more money in.There is a general exception to this observation when the founders are already well-known and have impressive track records.  Those seed rounds are almost always competitive.\n\nNote that other investors thinking an investment is bad does\nnot guarantee success.  For the total write-offs\nI’ve had so far, other investors also told me they were going to be\nterrible.  Being contrarian and wrong is\nstill bad—you have to be contrarian and right.  I think the only takeaway about what other investors think is that you should ignore it.\n\nGreat companies often look like bad ideas at the beginning—at a\nminimum, if it looks great, the seed round is likely to be overpriced, and\nthere are likely to be a lot of other people starting similar companies.  But even when I attempt to adjust for price,\nthe hot-round investments still have underperformed.\n\nI asked a few other investors about their experiences, and\nmost are roughly similar.  Most of the\nreally big hits never had TechCrunch writing about their super competitive seed\nround everyone was trying to get in.\n\nI think there are a lot of reasons for this.  A big one is that being good at fundraising\nhas very little to do with running a good company.  Another is that most investors are actually\nvery risk-averse despite what they say, and the great companies look really\nrisky at the seed stage.  And a major\nthird is that it’s just very hard to pick well at the seed stage, and most\ncompanies don’t have hot seed rounds, so most successful companies don’t either\n(though I don’t think this random distribution fully explains the phenomenon).  But in any case, founders shouldn’t worry if their\nseed round isn’t massively oversubscribed."

[3] Total government spending has\nrisen from about 8% of GDP to above 40% of GDP. \nSpending on social support programs has grown the fastest.  Defense spending has been on a reasonable\ndecline since WWII.  Personally, I think\nthat current levels of social support spending are ok (though maybe the spending should be distributed differently), and we should probably do\nmore. \nBut I think we need to plan for it.  In addition to thinking about new sorts of\njobs to replace lost jobs that aren’t coming back, we should probably think\nabout things like some version of a basic income.  I'm not sure it's the optimal solution (in fact, I have a strong intuitive bias against it) but I can't come up with a better suggestion, and I think it would probably lead to less waste than current social safety net systems.\n\n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n   4)  \nInterest rates are low—in fact, we’ve been near\nzero for 5 years, and on a steady trajectory down for 30.  This is historically highly unusual.   In fact, with quantitative easing, rates are\nreally less than zero (and they are officially negative in Europe).  On the positive side, but as you’d expect with\nnear-zero rates, US equities are at record levels.\n\n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n5)  \nPersonal savings rates are low.        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nOn the other hand, corporate savings rates are high.  US corporations hold 2.3x as much cash as\nthey held 20 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.  Individuals aren’t saving as much, and\ncompanies aren’t investing as much.\n\n\n\nAs I said at the beginning, all of this interrelates.  Any one data point could be fine in\nisolation, but if, for example, interest rates are zero (or government spending\nis high), you’d like to see growth be high because people should be borrowing\nmoney and investing it.\n\nI think that startups and venture capital will continue to\ndo well.  Most investors don’t want to\nhold cash, for obvious reasons, and so they’re looking for high-growth places\nto invest.  But I’m a little unsure how\nmuch the startup world and the rest of the economy can decouple.\n\nTo reiterate, I think we’ll find a way through these\neconomic challenges.  But I think it’s\nimportant we not ignore it and pretend it will magically get better, which\nseems to be the current plan. \nPersonally, I think that innovation and new technology is what will save\nus.\n\nWe need to get back to natural economic growth.  The US has been very fortunate to have a long\nhistory of growth—we had roughly 100 years of territory expansion and then\nroughly 100 years of incredible technological innovation.  I think the path from our troubles will\ninvolve finding a way for economic growth to continue.\n\n \n\n[1] http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/25/economists-react-to-2-9-q1-gdp-revision-different-shades-of-nasty/\n\n[2] http://useconomy.about.com/od/usdebtanddeficit/a/National-Debt-by-Year.htm\n\n[3] http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/what-is-driving-growth-in-government-spending/"

        "正文": "Richard Hamming gave this talk in March of 1986. [1]  It's one of the best talks I've ever read and has long impacted how I think about spending my time.I mentioned it to a number of people this weekend who, to my surprise, had never heard of it.  So I though I'd share it here:[Addition 5/28/23: see this great annotated version from Gwern.]It's a pleasure to be here. I doubt if I can live up to the Introduction. The title of my talk is, ``You and Your Research.'' It is not about managing research, it is about how you individually do your research. I could give a talk on the other subject - but it's not, it's about you. I'm not talking about ordinary run-of-the-mill research; I'm talking about great research. And for the sake of describing great research I'll occasionally say Nobel-Prize type of work. It doesn't have to gain the Nobel Prize, but I mean those kinds of things which we perceive are significant things. Relativity, if you want, Shannon's information theory, any number of outstanding theories - that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.Now, how did I come to do this study? At Los Alamos I was brought in to run the computing machines which other people had got going, so those scientists and physicists could get back to business. I saw I was a stooge. I saw that although physically I was the same, they were different. And to put the thing bluntly, I was envious. I wanted to know why they were so different from me. I saw Feynman up close. I saw Fermi and Teller. I saw Oppenheimer. I saw Hans Bethe: he was my boss. I saw quite a few very capable people. I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done.When I came to Bell Labs, I came into a very productive department. Bode was the department head at the time; Shannon was there, and there were other people. I continued examining the questions, ``Why?'' and ``What is the difference?'' I continued subsequently by reading biographies, autobiographies, asking people questions such as: ``How did you come to do this?'' I tried to find out what are the differences. And that's what this talk is about.Now, why is this talk important? I think it is important because, as far as I know, each of you has one life to live. Even if you believe in reincarnation it doesn't do you any good from one life to the next! Why shouldn't you do significant things in this one life, however you define significant? I'm not going to define it - you know what I mean. I will talk mainly about science because that is what I have studied. But so far as I know, and I've been told by others, much of what I say applies to many fields. Outstanding work is characterized very much the same way in most fields, but I will confine myself to science.In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do first-class work.'' Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do something significant.''In order to get to the second stage, I have to drop modesty and talk in the first person about what I've seen, what I've done, and what I've heard. I'm going to talk about people, some of whom you know, and I trust that when we leave, you won't quote me as saying some of the things I said.Let me start not logically, but psychologically. I find that the major objection is that people think great science is done by luck. It's all a matter of luck. Well, consider Einstein. Note how many different things he did that were good. Was it all luck? Wasn't it a little too repetitive? Consider Shannon. He didn't do just information theory. Several years before, he did some other good things and some which are still locked up in the security of cryptography. He did many good things.You see again and again, that it is more than one thing from a good person. Once in a while a person does only one thing in his whole life, and we'll talk about that later, but a lot of times there is repetition. I claim that luck will not cover everything. And I will cite Pasteur who said, ``Luck favors the prepared mind.'' And I think that says it the way I believe it. There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn't. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.For example, when I came to Bell Labs, I shared an office for a while with Shannon. At the same time he was doing information theory, I was doing coding theory. It is suspicious that the two of us did it at the same place and at the same time - it was in the atmosphere. And you can say, ``Yes, it was luck.'' On the other hand you can say, ``But why of all the people in Bell Labs then were those the two who did it?'' Yes, it is partly luck, and partly it is the prepared mind; but `partly' is the other thing I'm going to talk about. So, although I'll come back several more times to luck, I want to dispose of this matter of luck as being the sole criterion whether you do great work or not. I claim you have some, but not total, control over it. And I will quote, finally, Newton on the matter. Newton said, ``If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results.''One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them. For example, Einstein, somewhere around 12 or 14, asked himself the question, ``What would a light wave look like if I went with the velocity of light to look at it?'' Now he knew that electromagnetic theory says you cannot have a stationary local maximum. But if he moved along with the velocity of light, he would see a local maximum. He could see a contradiction at the age of 12, 14, or somewhere around there, that everything was not right and that the velocity of light had something peculiar. Is it luck that he finally created special relativity? Early on, he had laid down some of the pieces by thinking of the fragments. Now that's the necessary but not sufficient condition. All of these items I will talk about are both luck and not luck.How about having lots of `brains?' It sounds good. Most of you in this room probably have more than enough brains to do first-class work. But great work is something else than mere brains. Brains are measured in various ways. In mathematics, theoretical physics, astrophysics, typically brains correlates to a great extent with the ability to manipulate symbols. And so the typical IQ test is apt to score them fairly high. On the other hand, in other fields it is something different. For example, Bill Pfann, the fellow who did zone melting, came into my office one day. He had this idea dimly in his mind about what he wanted and he had some equations. It was pretty clear to me that this man didn't know much mathematics and he wasn't really articulate. His problem seemed interesting so I took it home and did a little work. I finally showed him how to run computers so he could compute his own answers. I gave him the power to compute. He went ahead, with negligible recognition from his own department, but ultimately he has collected all the prizes in the field. Once he got well started, his shyness, his awkwardness, his inarticulateness, fell away and he became much more productive in many other ways. Certainly he became much more articulate.And I can cite another person in the same way. I trust he isn't in the audience, i.e. a fellow named Clogston. I met him when I was working on a problem with John Pierce's group and I didn't think he had much. I asked my friends who had been with him at school, ``Was he like that in graduate school?'' ``Yes,'' they replied. Well I would have fired the fellow, but J. R. Pierce was smart and kept him on. Clogston finally did the Clogston cable. After that there was a steady stream of good ideas. One success brought him confidence and courage.One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely. You have only to think of his major theorem. He wants to create a method of coding, but he doesn't know what to do so he makes a random code. Then he is stuck. And then he asks the impossible question, ``What would the average random code do?'' He then proves that the average code is arbitrarily good, and that therefore there must be at least one good code. Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared to think those thoughts? That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think.Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about. They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it. Einstein did things very early, and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly young when they did their best work. Most mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young. It is not that they don't do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early. On the other hand, in music, politics and literature, often what we consider their best work was done late. I don't know how whatever field you are in fits this scale, but age has some effect.But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work. You may find yourself as I saw Brattain when he got a Nobel Prize. The day the prize was announced we all assembled in Arnold Auditorium; all three winners got up and made speeches. The third one, Brattain, practically with tears in his eyes, said, ``I know about this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter Brattain.'' Well I said to myself, ``That is nice.'' But in a few weeks I saw it was affecting him. Now he could only work on great problems.When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. In fact I will give you my favorite quotation of many years. The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in my opinion, has ruined more good scientists than any institution has created, judged by what they did before they came and judged by what they did after. Not that they weren't good afterwards, but they were superb before they got there and were only good afterwards.This brings up the subject, out of order perhaps, of working conditions. What most people think are the best working conditions, are not. Very clearly they are not because people are often most productive when working conditions are bad. One of the better times of the Cambridge Physical Laboratories was when they had practically shacks - they did some of the best physics ever.I give you a story from my own private life. Early on it became evident to me that Bell Laboratories was not going to give me the conventional acre of programming people to program computing machines in absolute binary. It was clear they weren't going to. But that was the way everybody did it. I could go to the West Coast and get a job with the airplane companies without any trouble, but the exciting people were at Bell Labs and the fellows out there in the airplane companies were not. I thought for a long while about, ``Did I want to go or not?'' and I wondered how I could get the best of two possible worlds. I finally said to myself, ``Hamming, you think the machines can do practically everything. Why can't you make them write programs?'' What appeared at first to me as a defect forced me into automatic programming very early. What appears to be a fault, often, by a change of viewpoint, turns out to be one of the greatest assets you can have. But you are not likely to think that when you first look the thing and say, ``Gee, I'm never going to get enough programmers, so how can I ever do any great programming?''And there are many other stories of the same kind; Grace Hopper has similar ones. I think that if you look carefully you will see that often the great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an asset. For example, many scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem finally began to study why not. They then turned it around the other way and said, ``But of course, this is what it is'' and got an important result. So ideal working conditions are very strange. The ones you want aren't always the best ones for you.Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode's office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?'' He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, ``You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.'' I simply slunk out of the office!What Bode was saying was this: ``Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no question about this.On this matter of drive Edison says, ``Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.'' He may have been exaggerating, but the idea is that solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far. The steady application of effort with a little bit more work, intelligently applied is what does it. That's the trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn't get you anywhere. I've often wondered why so many of my good friends at Bell Labs who worked as hard or harder than I did, didn't have so much to show for it. The misapplication of effort is a very serious matter. Just hard work is not enough - it must be applied sensibly.There's another trait on the side which I want to talk about; that trait is ambiguity. It took me a while to discover its importance. Most people like to believe something is or is not true. Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it. Darwin writes in his autobiography that he found it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his mind. When you find apparent flaws you've got to be sensitive and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them. Those are often the great contributions. Great contributions are rarely done by adding another decimal place. It comes down to an emotional commitment. Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don't become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class work.Now again, emotional commitment is not enough. It is a necessary condition apparently. And I think I can tell you the reason why. Everybody who has studied creativity is driven finally to saying, ``creativity comes out of your subconscious.'' Somehow, suddenly, there it is. It just appears. Well, we know very little about the subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come out of your subconscious. And you're aware your dreams are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day. If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.Now Alan Chynoweth mentioned that I used to eat at the physics table. I had been eating with the mathematicians and I found out that I already knew a fair amount of mathematics; in fact, I wasn't learning much. The physics table was, as he said, an exciting place, but I think he exaggerated on how much I contributed. It was very interesting to listen to Shockley, Brattain, Bardeen, J. B. Johnson, Ken McKay and other people, and I was learning a lot. But unfortunately a Nobel Prize came, and a promotion came, and what was left was the dregs. Nobody wanted what was left. Well, there was no use eating with them!Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time. I went over and said, ``Do you mind if I join you?'' They can't say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And I started asking, ``What are the important problems of your field?'' And after a week or so, ``What important problems are you working on?'' And after some more time I came in one day and said, ``If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?'' I wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! That was in the spring.In the fall, Dave McCall stopped me in the hall and said, ``Hamming, that remark of yours got underneath my skin. I thought about it all summer, i.e. what were the important problems in my field. I haven't changed my research,'' he says, ``but I think it was well worthwhile.'' And I said, ``Thank you Dave,'' and went on. I noticed a couple of months later he was made the head of the department. I noticed the other day he was a Member of the National Academy of Engineering. I noticed he has succeeded. I have never heard the names of any of the other fellows at that table mentioned in science and scientific circles. They were unable to ask themselves, ``What are the important problems in my field?''If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work. It's perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn you, `important problem' must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn't believe that they will lead to important problems.I spoke earlier about planting acorns so that oaks will grow. You can't always know exactly where to be, but you can keep active in places where something might happen. And even if you believe that great science is a matter of luck, you can stand on a mountain top where lightning strikes; you don't have to hide in the valley where you're safe. But the average scientist does routine safe work almost all the time and so he (or she) doesn't produce much. It's that simple. If you want to do great work, you clearly must work on important problems, and you should have an idea.Along those lines at some urging from John Tukey and others, I finally adopted what I called ``Great Thoughts Time.'' When I went to lunch Friday noon, I would only discuss great thoughts after that. By great thoughts I mean ones like: ``What will be the role of computers in all of AT&T?'', ``How will computers change science?'' For example, I came up with the observation at that time that nine out of ten experiments were done in the lab and one in ten on the computer. I made a remark to the vice presidents one time, that it would be reversed, i.e. nine out of ten experiments would be done on the computer and one in ten in the lab. They knew I was a crazy mathematician and had no sense of reality. I knew they were wrong and they've been proved wrong while I have been proved right. They built laboratories when they didn't need them. I saw that computers were transforming science because I spent a lot of time asking ``What will be the impact of computers on science and how can I change it?'' I asked myself, ``How is it going to change Bell Labs?'' I remarked one time, in the same address, that more than one-half of the people at Bell Labs will be interacting closely with computing machines before I leave. Well, you all have terminals now. I thought hard about where was my field going, where were the opportunities, and what were the important things to do. Let me go there so there is a chance I can do important things.Most great scientists know many important problems. They have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack. And when they see a new idea come up, one hears them say ``Well that bears on this problem.'' They drop all the other things and get after it. Now I can tell you a horror story that was told to me but I can't vouch for the truth of it. I was sitting in an airport talking to a friend of mine from Los Alamos about how it was lucky that the fission experiment occurred over in Europe when it did because that got us working on the atomic bomb here in the US. He said ``No; at Berkeley we had gathered a bunch of data; we didn't get around to reducing it because we were building some more equipment, but if we had reduced that data we would have found fission.'' They had it in their hands and they didn't pursue it. They came in second!The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things. They get rid of other things and they get after an idea because they had already thought the thing through. Their minds are prepared; they see the opportunity and they go after it. Now of course lots of times it doesn't work out, but you don't have to hit many of them to do some great science. It's kind of easy. One of the chief tricks is to live a long time!Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.I want to talk on another topic. It is based on the song which I think many of you know, ``It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it.'' I'll start with an example of my own. I was conned into doing on a digital computer, in the absolute binary days, a problem which the best analog computers couldn't do. And I was getting an answer. When I thought carefully and said to myself, ``You know, Hamming, you're going to have to file a report on this military job; after you spend a lot of money you're going to have to account for it and every analog installation is going to want the report to see if they can't find flaws in it.'' I was doing the required integration by a rather crummy method, to say the least, but I was getting the answer. And I realized that in truth the problem was not just to get the answer; it was to demonstrate for the first time, and beyond question, that I could beat the analog computer on its own ground with a digital machine. I reworked the method of solution, created a theory which was nice and elegant, and changed the way we computed the answer; the results were no different. The published report had an elegant method which was later known for years as ``Hamming's Method of Integrating Differential Equations.'' It is somewhat obsolete now, but for a while it was a very good method. By changing the problem slightly, I did important work rather than trivial work.In the same way, when using the machine up in the attic in the early days, I was solving one problem after another after another; a fair number were successful and there were a few failures. I went home one Friday after finishing a problem, and curiously enough I wasn't happy; I was depressed. I could see life being a long sequence of one problem after another after another. After quite a while of thinking I decided, ``No, I should be in the mass production of a variable product. I should be concerned with all of next year's problems, not just the one in front of my face.'' By changing the question I still got the same kind of results or better, but I changed things and did important work. I attacked the major problem - How do I conquer machines and do all of next year's problems when I don't know what they are going to be? How do I prepare for it? How do I do this one so I'll be on top of it? How do I obey Newton's rule? He said, ``If I have seen further than others, it is because I've stood on the shoulders of giants.'' These days we stand on each other's feet!You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will indeed say, ``Yes, I've stood on so and so's shoulders and I saw further.'' The essence of science is cumulative. By changing a problem slightly you can often do great work rather than merely good work. Instead of attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.Now if you are much of a mathematician you know that the effort to generalize often means that the solution is simple. Often by stopping and saying, ``This is the problem he wants but this is characteristic of so and so. Yes, I can attack the whole class with a far superior method than the particular one because I was earlier embedded in needless detail.'' The business of abstraction frequently makes things simple. Furthermore, I filed away the methods and prepared for the future problems.To end this part, I'll remind you, ``It is a poor workman who blames his tools - the good man gets on with the job, given what he's got, and gets the best answer he can.'' And I suggest that by altering the problem, by looking at the thing differently, you can make a great deal of difference in your final productivity because you can either do it in such a fashion that people can indeed build on what you've done, or you can do it in such a fashion that the next person has to essentially duplicate again what you've done. It isn't just a matter of the job, it's the way you write the report, the way you write the paper, the whole attitude. It's just as easy to do a broad, general job as one very special case. And it's much more satisfying and rewarding!I have now come down to a topic which is very distasteful; it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it. `Selling' to a scientist is an awkward thing to do. It's very ugly; you shouldn't have to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something great, they should rush out and welcome it. But the fact is everyone is busy with their own work. You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you've done, read it, and come back and say, ``Yes, that was good.'' I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others. You had better write your report so when it is published in the Physical Review, or wherever else you want it, as the readers are turning the pages they won't just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours. If they don't stop and read it, you won't get credit.There are three things you have to do in selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks. We had a lot of so-called `back room scientists.' In a conference, they would keep quiet. Three weeks later after a decision was made they filed a report saying why you should do so and so. Well, it was too late. They would not stand up right in the middle of a hot conference, in the middle of activity, and say, ``We should do this for these reasons.'' You need to master that form of communication as well as prepared speeches.When I first started, I got practically physically ill while giving a speech, and I was very, very nervous. I realized I either had to learn to give speeches smoothly or I would essentially partially cripple my whole career. The first time IBM asked me to give a speech in New York one evening, I decided I was going to give a really good speech, a speech that was wanted, not a technical one but a broad one, and at the end if they liked it, I'd quietly say, ``Any time you want one I'll come in and give you one.'' As a result, I got a great deal of practice giving speeches to a limited audience and I got over being afraid. Furthermore, I could also then study what methods were effective and what were ineffective.While going to meetings I had already been studying why some papers are remembered and most are not. The technical person wants to give a highly limited technical talk. Most of the time the audience wants a broad general talk and wants much more survey and background than the speaker is willing to give. As a result, many talks are ineffective. The speaker names a topic and suddenly plunges into the details he's solved. Few people in the audience may follow. You should paint a general picture to say why it's important, and then slowly give a sketch of what was done. Then a larger number of people will say, ``Yes, Joe has done that,'' or ``Mary has done that; I really see where it is; yes, Mary really gave a good talk; I understand what Mary has done.'' The tendency is to give a highly restricted, safe talk; this is usually ineffective. Furthermore, many talks are filled with far too much information. So I say this idea of selling is obvious.Let me summarize. You've got to work on important problems. I deny that it is all luck, but I admit there is a fair element of luck. I subscribe to Pasteur's ``Luck favors the prepared mind.'' I favor heavily what I did. Friday afternoons for years - great thoughts only - means that I committed 10% of my time trying to understand the bigger problems in the field, i.e. what was and what was not important. I found in the early days I had believed `this' and yet had spent all week marching in `that' direction. It was kind of foolish. If I really believe the action is over there, why do I march in this direction? I either had to change my goal or change what I did. So I changed something I did and I marched in the direction I thought was important. It's that easy.Now you might tell me you haven't got control over what you have to work on. Well, when you first begin, you may not. But once you're moderately successful, there are more people asking for results than you can deliver and you have some power of choice, but not completely. I'll tell you a story about that, and it bears on the subject of educating your boss. I had a boss named Schelkunoff; he was, and still is, a very good friend of mine. Some military person came to me and demanded some answers by Friday. Well, I had already dedicated my computing resources to reducing data on the fly for a group of scientists; I was knee deep in short, small, important problems. This military person wanted me to solve his problem by the end of the day on Friday. I said, ``No, I'll give it to you Monday. I can work on it over the weekend. I'm not going to do it now.'' He goes down to my boss, Schelkunoff, and Schelkunoff says, ``You must run this for him; he's got to have it by Friday.'' I tell him, ``Why do I?''; he says, ``You have to.'' I said, ``Fine, Sergei, but you're sitting in your office Friday afternoon catching the late bus home to watch as this fellow walks out that door.'' I gave the military person the answers late Friday afternoon. I then went to Schelkunoff's office and sat down; as the man goes out I say, ``You see Schelkunoff, this fellow has nothing under his arm; but I gave him the answers.'' On Monday morning Schelkunoff called him up and said, ``Did you come in to work over the weekend?'' I could hear, as it were, a pause as the fellow ran through his mind of what was going to happen; but he knew he would have had to sign in, and he'd better not say he had when he hadn't, so he said he hadn't. Ever after that Schelkunoff said, ``You set your deadlines; you can change them.''One lesson was sufficient to educate my boss as to why I didn't want to do big jobs that displaced exploratory research and why I was justified in not doing crash jobs which absorb all the research computing facilities. I wanted instead to use the facilities to compute a large number of small problems. Again, in the early days, I was limited in computing capacity and it was clear, in my area, that a ``mathematician had no use for machines.'' But I needed more machine capacity. Every time I had to tell some scientist in some other area, ``No I can't; I haven't the machine capacity,'' he complained. I said ``Go tell your Vice President that Hamming needs more computing capacity.'' After a while I could see what was happening up there at the top; many people said to my Vice President, ``Your man needs more computing capacity.'' I got it!I also did a second thing. When I loaned what little programming power we had to help in the early days of computing, I said, ``We are not getting the recognition for our programmers that they deserve. When you publish a paper you will thank that programmer or you aren't getting any more help from me. That programmer is going to be thanked by name; she's worked hard.'' I waited a couple of years. I then went through a year of BSTJ articles and counted what fraction thanked some programmer. I took it into the boss and said, ``That's the central role computing is playing in Bell Labs; if the BSTJ is important, that's how important computing is.'' He had to give in. You can educate your bosses. It's a hard job. In this talk I'm only viewing from the bottom up; I'm not viewing from the top down. But I am telling you how you can get what you want in spite of top management. You have to sell your ideas there also.Well I now come down to the topic, ``Is the effort to be a great scientist worth it?'' To answer this, you must ask people. When you get beyond their modesty, most people will say, ``Yes, doing really first-class work, and knowing it, is as good as wine, women and song put together,'' or if it's a woman she says, ``It is as good as wine, men and song put together.'' And if you look at the bosses, they tend to come back or ask for reports, trying to participate in those moments of discovery. They're always in the way. So evidently those who have done it, want to do it again. But it is a limited survey. I have never dared to go out and ask those who didn't do great work how they felt about the matter. It's a biased sample, but I still think it is worth the struggle. I think it is very definitely worth the struggle to try and do first-class work because the truth is, the value is in the struggle more than it is in the result. The struggle to make something of yourself seems to be worthwhile in itself. The success and fame are sort of dividends, in my opinion.I've told you how to do it. It is so easy, so why do so many people, with all their talents, fail? For example, my opinion, to this day, is that there are in the mathematics department at Bell Labs quite a few people far more able and far better endowed than I, but they didn't produce as much. Some of them did produce more than I did; Shannon produced more than I did, and some others produced a lot, but I was highly productive against a lot of other fellows who were better equipped. Why is it so? What happened to them? Why do so many of the people who have great promise, fail?Well, one of the reasons is drive and commitment. The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day. They don't have the deep commitment that is apparently necessary for really first-class work. They turn out lots of good work, but we were talking, remember, about first-class work. There is a difference. Good people, very talented people, almost always turn out good work. We're talking about the outstanding work, the type of work that gets the Nobel Prize and gets recognition.The second thing is, I think, the problem of personality defects. Now I'll cite a fellow whom I met out in Irvine. He had been the head of a computing center and he was temporarily on assignment as a special assistant to the president of the university. It was obvious he had a job with a great future. He took me into his office one time and showed me his method of getting letters done and how he took care of his correspondence. He pointed out how inefficient the secretary was. He kept all his letters stacked around there; he knew where everything was. And he would, on his word processor, get the letter out. He was bragging how marvelous it was and how he could get so much more work done without the secretary's interference. Well, behind his back, I talked to the secretary. The secretary said, ``Of course I can't help him; I don't get his mail. He won't give me the stuff to log in; I don't know where he puts it on the floor. Of course I can't help him.'' So I went to him and said, ``Look, if you adopt the present method and do what you can do single-handedly, you can go just that far and no farther than you can do single-handedly. If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the system will support you.'' And, he never went any further. He had his personality defect of wanting total control and was not willing to recognize that you need the support of the system.You find this happening again and again; good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it. After all, if you want a decision `No', you just go to your boss and get a `No' easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a chance to tell you `No'. But if you want a `No', it's easy to get a `No'.Another personality defect is ego assertion and I'll speak in this case of my own experience. I came from Los Alamos and in the early days I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue where we merely rented time. I was still dressing in western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good service as other people. So I set out to measure. You came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not getting a fair deal. I said to myself, ``Why? No Vice President at IBM said, `Give Hamming a bad time'. It is the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a slot appears, they'll rush to find someone to slip in, but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why? I haven't mistreated them.'' Answer, I wasn't dressing the way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came down to just that - I wasn't dressing properly. I had to make the decision - was I going to assert my ego and dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my effort from my professional life, or was I going to appear to conform better? I decided I would make an effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did, I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful character, I get better service than other people.You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to. If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.John Tukey almost always dressed very casually. He would go into an important office and it would take a long time before the other fellow realized that this is a first-class man and he had better listen. For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of hostility. It's wasted effort! I didn't say you should conform; I said ``The appearance of conforming gets you a long way.'' If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, ``I am going to do it my way,'' you pay a small steady price throughout the whole of your professional career. And this, over a whole lifetime, adds up to an enormous amount of needless trouble.By taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a little friendly, I got superb secretarial help. For instance, one time for some idiot reason all the reproducing services at Murray Hill were tied up. Don't ask me how, but they were. I wanted something done. My secretary called up somebody at Holmdel, hopped the company car, made the hour-long trip down and got it reproduced, and then came back. It was a payoff for the times I had made an effort to cheer her up, tell her jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra work that later paid off for me. By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.And I think John Tukey paid a terrible price needlessly. He was a genius anyhow, but I think it would have been far better, and far simpler, had he been willing to conform a little bit instead of ego asserting. He is going to dress the way he wants all of the time. It applies not only to dress but to a thousand other things; people will continue to fight the system. Not that you shouldn't occasionally!When they moved the library from the middle of Murray Hill to the far end, a friend of mine put in a request for a bicycle. Well, the organization was not dumb. They waited awhile and sent back a map of the grounds saying, ``Will you please indicate on this map what paths you are going to take so we can get an insurance policy covering you.'' A few more weeks went by. They then asked, ``Where are you going to store the bicycle and how will it be locked so we can do so and so.'' He finally realized that of course he was going to be red-taped to death so he gave in. He rose to be the President of Bell Laboratories.Barney Oliver was a good man. He wrote a letter one time to the IEEE. At that time the official shelf space at Bell Labs was so much and the height of the IEEE Proceedings at that time was larger; and since you couldn't change the size of the official shelf space he wrote this letter to the IEEE Publication person saying, ``Since so many IEEE members were at Bell Labs and since the official space was so high the journal size should be changed.'' He sent it for his boss's signature. Back came a carbon with his signature, but he still doesn't know whether the original was sent or not. I am not saying you shouldn't make gestures of reform. I am saying that my study of able people is that they don't get themselves committed to that kind of warfare. They play it a little bit and drop it and get on with their work.Many a second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the system. I agree; somebody's has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science? Which person is it that you want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system. My advice is to let somebody else do it and you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. Very few of you have the ability to both reform the system and become a first-class scientist.On the other hand, we can't always give in. There are times when a certain amount of rebellion is sensible. I have observed almost all scientists enjoy a certain amount of twitting the system for the sheer love of it. What it comes down to basically is that you cannot be original in one area without having originality in others. Originality is being different. You can't be an original scientist without having some other original characteristics. But many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make him pay a far higher price than is necessary for the ego satisfaction he or she gets. I'm not against all ego assertion; I'm against some.Another fault is anger. Often a scientist becomes angry, and this is no way to handle things. Amusement, yes, anger, no. Anger is misdirected. You should follow and cooperate rather than struggle against the system all the time.Another thing you should look for is the positive side of things instead of the negative. I have already given you several examples, and there are many, many more; how, given the situation, by changing the way I looked at it, I converted what was apparently a defect to an asset. I'll give you another example. I am an egotistical person; there is no doubt about it. I knew that most people who took a sabbatical to write a book, didn't finish it on time. So before I left, I told all my friends that when I come back, that book was going to be done! Yes, I would have it done - I'd have been ashamed to come back without it! I used my ego to make myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about something so I'd have to perform. I found out many times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was surprisingly capable. I have found that it paid to say, ``Oh yes, I'll get the answer for you Tuesday,'' not having any idea how to do it. By Sunday night I was really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by Tuesday. I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I'm surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.Now self-delusion in humans is very, very common. There are enumerable ways of you changing a thing and kidding yourself and making it look some other way. When you ask, ``Why didn't you do such and such,'' the person has a thousand alibis. If you look at the history of science, usually these days there are 10 people right there ready, and we pay off for the person who is there first. The other nine fellows say, ``Well, I had the idea but I didn't do it and so on and so on.'' There are so many alibis. Why weren't you first? Why didn't you do it right? Don't try an alibi. Don't try and kid yourself. You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I don't mind. But to yourself try to be honest.If you really want to be a first-class scientist you need to know yourself, your weaknesses, your strengths, and your bad faults, like my egotism. How can you convert a fault to an asset? How can you convert a situation where you haven't got enough manpower to move into a direction when that's exactly what you need to do? I say again that I have seen, as I studied the history, the successful scientist changed the viewpoint and what was a defect became an asset.In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they don't work on important problems, they don't become emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't. They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is; furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!DISCUSSION - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSA. G. Chynoweth: Well that was 50 minutes of concentrated wisdom and observations accumulated over a fantastic career; I lost track of all the observations that were striking home. Some of them are very very timely. One was the plea for more computer capacity; I was hearing nothing but that this morning from several people, over and over again. So that was right on the mark today even though here we are 20 - 30 years after when you were making similar remarks, Dick. I can think of all sorts of lessons that all of us can draw from your talk. And for one, as I walk around the halls in the future I hope I won't see as many closed doors in Bellcore. That was one observation I thought was very intriguing.Thank you very, very much indeed Dick; that was a wonderful recollection. I'll now open it up for questions. I'm sure there are many people who would like to take up on some of the points that Dick was making.Hamming: First let me respond to Alan Chynoweth about computing. I had computing in research and for 10 years I kept telling my management, ``Get that !&@#% machine out of research. We are being forced to run problems all the time. We can't do research because were too busy operating and running the computing machines.'' Finally the message got through. They were going to move computing out of research to someplace else. I was persona non grata to say the least and I was surprised that people didn't kick my shins because everybody was having their toy taken away from them. I went in to Ed David's office and said, ``Look Ed, you've got to give your researchers a machine. If you give them a great big machine, we'll be back in the same trouble we were before, so busy keeping it going we can't think. Give them the smallest machine you can because they are very able people. They will learn how to do things on a small machine instead of mass computing.'' As far as I'm concerned, that's how UNIX arose. We gave them a moderately small machine and they decided to make it do great things. They had to come up with a system to do it on. It is called UNIX!A. G. Chynoweth: I just have to pick up on that one. In our present environment, Dick, while we wrestle with some of the red tape attributed to, or required by, the regulators, there is one quote that one exasperated AVP came up with and I've used it over and over again. He growled that, ``UNIX was never a deliverable!''Question: What about personal stress? Does that seem to make a difference?Hamming: Yes, it does. If you don't get emotionally involved, it doesn't. I had incipient ulcers most of the years that I was at Bell Labs. I have since gone off to the Naval Postgraduate School and laid back somewhat, and now my health is much better. But if you want to be a great scientist you're going to have to put up with stress. You can lead a nice life; you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist. But nice guys end last, is what Leo Durocher said. If you want to lead a nice happy life with a lot of recreation and everything else, you'll lead a nice life.Question: The remarks about having courage, no one could argue with; but those of us who have gray hairs or who are well established don't have to worry too much. But what I sense among the young people these days is a real concern over the risk taking in a highly competitive environment. Do you have any words of wisdom on this?Hamming: I'll quote Ed David more. Ed David was concerned about the general loss of nerve in our society. It does seem to me that we've gone through various periods. Coming out of the war, coming out of Los Alamos where we built the bomb, coming out of building the radars and so on, there came into the mathematics department, and the research area, a group of people with a lot of guts. They've just seen things done; they've just won a war which was fantastic. We had reasons for having courage and therefore we did a great deal. I can't arrange that situation to do it again. I cannot blame the present generation for not having it, but I agree with what you say; I just cannot attach blame to it. It doesn't seem to me they have the desire for greatness; they lack the courage to do it. But we had, because we were in a favorable circumstance to have it; we just came through a tremendously successful war. In the war we were looking very, very bad for a long while; it was a very desperate struggle as you well know. And our success, I think, gave us courage and self confidence; that's why you see, beginning in the late forties through the fifties, a tremendous productivity at the labs which was stimulated from the earlier times. Because many of us were earlier forced to learn other things - we were forced to learn the things we didn't want to learn, we were forced to have an open door - and then we could exploit those things we learned. It is true, and I can't do anything about it; I cannot blame the present generation either. It's just a fact.Question: Is there something management could or should do?Hamming: Management can do very little. If you want to talk about managing research, that's a totally different talk. I'd take another hour doing that. This talk is about how the individual gets very successful research done in spite of anything the management does or in spite of any other opposition. And how do you do it? Just as I observe people doing it. It's just that simple and that hard!Question: Is brainstorming a daily process?Hamming: Once that was a very popular thing, but it seems not to have paid off. For myself I find it desirable to talk to other people; but a session of brainstorming is seldom worthwhile. I do go in to strictly talk to somebody and say, ``Look, I think there has to be something here. Here's what I think I see ...'' and then begin talking back and forth. But you want to pick capable people. To use another analogy, you know the idea called the `critical mass.' If you have enough stuff you have critical mass. There is also the idea I used to call `sound absorbers'. When you get too many sound absorbers, you give out an idea and they merely say, ``Yes, yes, yes.'' What you want to do is get that critical mass in action; ``Yes, that reminds me of so and so,'' or, ``Have you thought about that or this?'' When you talk to other people, you want to get rid of those sound absorbers who are nice people but merely say, ``Oh yes,'' and to find those who will stimulate you right back.For example, you couldn't talk to John Pierce without being stimulated very quickly. There were a group of other people I used to talk with. For example there was Ed Gilbert; I used to go down to his office regularly and ask him questions and listen and come back stimulated. I picked my people carefully with whom I did or whom I didn't brainstorm because the sound absorbers are a curse. They are just nice guys; they fill the whole space and they contribute nothing except they absorb ideas and the new ideas just die away instead of echoing on. Yes, I find it necessary to talk to people. I think people with closed doors fail to do this so they fail to get their ideas sharpened, such as ``Did you ever notice something over here?'' I never knew anything about it - I can go over and look. Somebody points the way. On my visit here, I have already found several books that I must read when I get home. I talk to people and ask questions when I think they can answer me and give me clues that I do not know about. I go out and look!Question: What kind of tradeoffs did you make in allocating your time for reading and writing and actually doing research?Hamming: I believed, in my early days, that you should spend at least as much time in the polish and presentation as you did in the original research. Now at least 50% of the time must go for the presentation. It's a big, big number.Question: How much effort should go into library work?Hamming: It depends upon the field. I will say this about it. There was a fellow at Bell Labs, a very, very, smart guy. He was always in the library; he read everything. If you wanted references, you went to him and he gave you all kinds of references. But in the middle of forming these theories, I formed a proposition: there would be no effect named after him in the long run. He is now retired from Bell Labs and is an Adjunct Professor. He was very valuable; I'm not questioning that. He wrote some very good Physical Review articles; but there's no effect named after him because he read too much. If you read all the time what other people have done you will think the way they thought. If you want to think new thoughts that are different, then do what a lot of creative people do - get the problem reasonably clear and then refuse to look at any answers until you've thought the problem through carefully how you would do it, how you could slightly change the problem to be the correct one. So yes, you need to keep up. You need to keep up more to find out what the problems are than to read to find the solutions. The reading is necessary to know what is going on and what is possible. But reading to get the solutions does not seem to be the way to do great research. So I'll give you two answers. You read; but it is not the amount, it is the way you read that counts.Question: How do you get your name attached to things?Hamming: By doing great work. I'll tell you the hamming window one. I had given Tukey a hard time, quite a few times, and I got a phone call from him from Princeton to me at Murray Hill. I knew that he was writing up power spectra and he asked me if I would mind if he called a certain window a ``Hamming window.'' And I said to him, ``Come on, John; you know perfectly well I did only a small part of the work but you also did a lot.'' He said, ``Yes, Hamming, but you contributed a lot of small things; you're entitled to some credit.'' So he called it the hamming window. Now, let me go on. I had twitted John frequently about true greatness. I said true greatness is when your name is like ampere, watt, and fourier - when it's spelled with a lower case letter. That's how the hamming window came about.Question: Dick, would you care to comment on the relative effectiveness between giving talks, writing papers, and writing books?Hamming: In the short-haul, papers are very important if you want to stimulate someone tomorrow. If you want to get recognition long-haul, it seems to me writing books is more contribution because most of us need orientation. In this day of practically infinite knowledge, we need orientation to find our way. Let me tell you what infinite knowledge is. Since from the time of Newton to now, we have come close to doubling knowledge every 17 years, more or less. And we cope with that, essentially, by specialization. In the next 340 years at that rate, there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there will be a million fields of specialty for every one field now. It isn't going to happen. The present growth of knowledge will choke itself off until we get different tools. I believe that books which try to digest, coordinate, get rid of the duplication, get rid of the less fruitful methods and present the underlying ideas clearly of what we know now, will be the things the future generations will value. Public talks are necessary; private talks are necessary; written papers are necessary. But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out what's not essential are more important than books which tell you everything because you don't want to know everything. I don't want to know that much about penguins is the usual reply. You just want to know the essence.Question: You mentioned the problem of the Nobel Prize and the subsequent notoriety of what was done to some of the careers. Isn't that kind of a much more broad problem of fame? What can one do?Hamming: Some things you could do are the following. Somewhere around every seven years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your field. Thus, I shifted from numerical analysis, to hardware, to software, and so on, periodically, because you tend to use up your ideas. When you go to a new field, you have to start over as a baby. You are no longer the big mukity muk and you can start back there and you can start planting those acorns which will become the giant oaks. Shannon, I believe, ruined himself. In fact when he left Bell Labs, I said, ``That's the end of Shannon's scientific career.'' I received a lot of flak from my friends who said that Shannon was just as smart as ever. I said, ``Yes, he'll be just as smart, but that's the end of his scientific career,'' and I truly believe it was.You have to change. You get tired after a while; you use up your originality in one field. You need to get something nearby. I'm not saying that you shift from music to theoretical physics to English literature; I mean within your field you should shift areas so that you don't go stale. You couldn't get away with forcing a change every seven years, but if you could, I would require a condition for doing research, being that you will change your field of research every seven years with a reasonable definition of what it means, or at the end of 10 years, management has the right to compel you to change. I would insist on a change because I'm serious. What happens to the old fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on using it. They were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There's the new direction; but the old fellows are still marching in their former direction.You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints, and before you use up all the old ones. You can do something about this, but it takes effort and energy. It takes courage to say, ``Yes, I will give up my great reputation.'' For example, when error correcting codes were well launched, having these theories, I said, ``Hamming, you are going to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to ignore it completely; you are going to try and do something else other than coast on that.'' I deliberately refused to go on in that field. I wouldn't even read papers to try to force myself to have a chance to do something else. I managed myself, which is what I'm preaching in this whole talk. Knowing many of my own faults, I manage myself. I have a lot of faults, so I've got a lot of problems, i.e. a lot of possibilities of management.Question: Would you compare research and management?Hamming: If you want to be a great researcher, you won't make it being president of the company. If you want to be president of the company, that's another thing. I'm not against being president of the company. I just don't want to be. I think Ian Ross does a good job as President of Bell Labs. I'm not against it; but you have to be clear on what you want. Furthermore, when you're young, you may have picked wanting to be a great scientist, but as you live longer, you may change your mind. For instance, I went to my boss, Bode, one day and said, ``Why did you ever become department head? Why didn't you just be a good scientist?'' He said, ``Hamming, I had a vision of what mathematics should be in Bell Laboratories. And I saw if that vision was going to be realized, I had to make it happen; I had to be department head.'' When your vision of what you want to do is what you can do single-handedly, then you should pursue it. The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward management. And the bigger the vision is, the farther in management you have to go. If you have a vision of what the whole laboratory should be, or the whole Bell System, you have to get there to make it happen. You can't make it happen from the bottom very easily. It depends upon what goals and what desires you have. And as they change in life, you have to be prepared to change. I chose to avoid management because I preferred to do what I could do single-handedly. But that's the choice that I made, and it is biased. Each person is entitled to their choice. Keep an open mind. But when you do choose a path, for heaven's sake be aware of what you have done and the choice you have made. Don't try to do both sides.Question: How important is one's own expectation or how important is it to be in a group or surrounded by people who expect great work from you?Hamming: At Bell Labs everyone expected good work from me - it was a big help. Everybody expects you to do a good job, so you do, if you've got pride. I think it's very valuable to have first-class people around. I sought out the best people. The moment that physics table lost the best people, I left. The moment I saw that the same was true of the chemistry table, I left. I tried to go with people who had great ability so I could learn from them and who would expect great results out of me. By deliberately managing myself, I think I did much better than laissez faire.Question: You, at the outset of your talk, minimized or played down luck; but you seemed also to gloss over the circumstances that got you to Los Alamos, that got you to Chicago, that got you to Bell Laboratories.Hamming: There was some luck. On the other hand I don't know the alternate branches. Until you can say that the other branches would not have been equally or more successful, I can't say. Is it luck the particular thing you do? For example, when I met Feynman at Los Alamos, I knew he was going to get a Nobel Prize. I didn't know what for. But I knew darn well he was going to do great work. No matter what directions came up in the future, this man would do great work. And sure enough, he did do great work. It isn't that you only do a little great work at this circumstance and that was luck, there are many opportunities sooner or later. There are a whole pail full of opportunities, of which, if you're in this situation, you seize one and you're great over there instead of over here. There is an element of luck, yes and no. Luck favors a prepared mind; luck favors a prepared person. It is not guaranteed; I don't guarantee success as being absolutely certain. I'd say luck changes the odds, but there is some definite control on the part of the individual.Go forth, then, and do great work![1] http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"

        "正文": "People have been saying that startup valuations are really\nhigh for about 3 years now.  I myself\nfeel that they are high, but I have no idea when they are likely to change.\n\nIt’s mostly investors that talk about valuations being way\ntoo high.  But they’re the ones that keep\nwillingly paying higher and higher prices. \nIn fact, they keep raising larger and larger funds.  So I think there has to be a discount rate on\nthe claim.\n\nThe most important reason for this is simple\ncapitalism—large pools of money look for the best risk-adjusted return.  Interest rates are effectively zero (and\nnegative in Europe!) and will likely remain that way for awhile— the Fed has\ncontinually been too optimistic about when the economy will pick back up.   So fixed income is bad, and partially\nbecause of that, public equities, real estate, etc all feel really expensive.\n\nThe fundamental problem driving this lack of opportunity for\ncapital, in my somewhat controversial opinion, is a lack of GDP growth.  Startups have growth, though, and so they\nattract investment interest.\n\nThere have been a lot of startup success stories in the last\ndecade, and a lot more people want to invest in startups than ever before\nexcept maybe the 2000 bubble. \nCrowdfunding (probably the most important new force in startup investing)\nis providing more competition for early-stage investments, and hedge funds and\nprivate equity firms are starting to do a lot more late-stage investing.  Angel investors are raising funds at an\nastonishing rate.   Some of these new\ninvestors invest partially for social status, not just a financial return, and\nso are willing to pay relatively higher prices.\n\nA lot of these new investors are willing to accept lower\nreturns than VC firms, given the alternative options for investing the\ncapital.  But VC firms will continue to\ninvest, of course, even if the prices are higher than they’d like. [1]\n\nThe number of good startups is increasing every year, but\nnot as fast as the investment dollars are. \nAnd so there is a supply and demand mismatch, and prices are going up.\n\nVC has worked, at least partially, on special access and\ninformation asymmetry.  (VCs pitch their\nLPs about this and call it “competitive differentiation”.)  But access to startups has gotten much\neasier.  If you’re a VC firm still\ndepending on this, you’re very likely failing. \n\nThe good VCs are doing new things to remain on top.  Some firms are focusing on providing services\nlike recruiting, business development, PR, and many others to their startups.   Some firms are trying to focus on having\npartners that are former founders.  Still\nothers are trying to focus on contrarian investments.  All of this is great for founders.\n\nA lot of the traditional “non-starter” terms from VCs are\nalready going away.  We’re seeing more and more\nA rounds happen with less than 20% ownership going to the investors, and fewer\nand fewer requirements about investor control over the company.  Unfortunately, some good things are going\naway also.\n\nIt turns out to be really good for a company to have a\nboard—it focuses the company if everyone knows they have to present the key\nmetrics to outsiders once a month.  Some\ninvestors feel that if they own a smaller percentage of the company, they are\nwilling to put in money but not time. \nBut I don’t think this strategy will work for long—if that’s the sales\npitch, then founders will take the cheapest capital, and the crowd will\nprobably pay more than VCs.  If I could\nask VCs for only one thing in this new world, it’d be to keep showing up for\nboard meetings. [2]\n\nI believe good angel and venture investors really do add\nvalue, and most founders are rightly willing to take somewhat worse terms to\nwork with people they believe will really help them.  But the capital markets are moving fast, and\ninvestors will have to keep up (this was part of our thinking about increasing\nthe standard YC offer).\n\nSo what should founders do now that valuations are higher?\n\nDefinitely don’t start a company just because capital is\navailable.  Remember that cheap capital\ndoesn’t make starting a company much easier. \nIt only does stuff like drive up rent. \nSuccess will still take a very long time.  And it’s definitely still bad to chase\nabove-market valuations—you’ll price out people that will actually help.  Just take market terms and get back to work. \n\nResist the urge to raise and spend too much money.  The track record of companies that raise\n$30MM or more in their first round is bad. \nYou may be one of the exceptions, but for a bunch of reasons, I think\nit’s better to have a small amount of money until everything is working, and\nonly then really hit the gas pedal. \n\nAlso, if capital feels cheap, it’s psychologically easier to\nspend.  It’s really important to stay\nfrugal.  In addition to the\noften-discussed correlation of low CEO pay with success, I’ve noticed that\nfrugal companies have a culture that ends up being much more focused on real results.  Frugal companies also tend to have a\nlong-term focus.  And on a practical\nlevel, it’s always possible that the capital you’ve raised now will be the last\nyou’ve ever raised.  You should treat it\nthat way.\n\nSome day the top-callers will be right.  It certainly feels to me like we may be in\nthe early days of a bubble (though valuations for brand new companies, which\nfelt most out of whack to me six months ago, seem to have come down somewhat).  And a macroeconomic collapse—which may\nhappen—would certainly correct valuations in a hurry.  But unless some macro event happens, it feels\nlike valuations can stay high. \nImportantly, a lot of these startups are generating real revenue and\nearnings.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n[1] My guess for what happens is that the great VCs continue\nto do well.   Many investors think new\nstartups will be worth more than most of the startups from ten years\nago—markets keep getting bigger, more good people are starting startups,\nstartups are becoming easier to start, distribution keeps getting easier, and\ninterest rates will probably stay low—or it’s possible that VCs will generate\nstill good but lower-than-historical returns.\n\n[2] The increase in valuations has led to some funny new\nbehaviors.  One of the funniest examples\nis a simultaneous obsession with the price other investors are paying—“Even\nthough I thought this price was good yesterday, I found out someone else is\ngetting to invest at a lower price and I’m furious”—coupled with a refrain of\n“I’ll work really hard for the company and add much more value than your other\ninvestors, so I’d like advisory shares or a discount to participate in your\nround”.  I hope investors will stop doing\nthese sorts of things. "

        "正文": "The price of bitcoin keeps trending down.  [1] This causes a lot of people to declare the\nend of bitcoin.\n\nIt’s important to understand that the default price pressure\nof the bitcoin ecosystem is down.  There\nare a lot of reasons for this, so I’ll just give a few examples. \n\nWhen most merchants take bitcoin for a purchase, they\nimmediately sell for dollars (they can’t usually pay their vendors in bitcoin,\nthey can’t pay tax in bitcoin, they don’t want to be exposed to the volatility,\netc.)\n\nWhen miners mine bitcoin, they have to sell some of them to\npay for the electricity in dollars (or, more likely, RMB).  As the difficulty goes up and the price of\nbitcoin goes down, they have to sell a larger and larger percentage of what\nthey mine.  In fact, as far as I can\ntell, mining is currently unprofitable with any reasonable cost of\nelectricity.  It still makes sense to\nmine if you’re living in a dorm and don’t pay for electricity, or if you can’t\npass a KYC check and are willing to pay a big premium to get bitcoin.\n\nThe recent US and international tax changes and tax filings\nalso caused sell pressure.  This will\ncontinue to be the case until the US government takes bitcoin for taxes.  If I ran the government, I would never do\nthis—the US needs the dollar to remain the world reserve currency.\n\nThere are plenty of other reasons, but the point is that\nbitcoin is different from many other financial markets, where the default\npressure is up. [2]\n\nThis doesn’t mean bitcoin is doomed.  It just means that for it to succeed, we’ll\nneed significant external buy pressure. \nAs I wrote awhile ago, I think the key thing we need for this is people\nactually using bitcoin for transactions instead of speculation (and merchants\nwilling to hold bitcoin balances). [3] Unfortunately, transaction volume still\nappears to be trending down. [4] Anecdotally, I hear from merchants who start\ntaking bitcoin that after an initial spike they see almost no volume.\n\nThe other way to get enough buy pressure would be if many\npeople started deciding they want to hold bitcoin as a hedge or a\nspeculation.  This spurs occasional\nbubbles, but we haven’t yet seen it work long term.\n\nA declining bitcoin price does not mean bitcoin is\nfailing.  And even if bitcoin itself fails,\nI think the blockchain will be one of key technical innovations of this time\nperiod.  In fact, in the most recent set\nof YC interviews, we saw more great blockchain companies than bitcoin\ncompanies.  Maybe Ripple or Dogecoin ends\nup winning. [5] Or maybe something that hasn’t been invented yet.\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine a future where the blockchain\nconcept isn’t really important.\n\n \n\n[1] http://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap\n\n[2] Paul Buchheit first made this point: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7570656\n\n[3] http://blog.samaltman.com/thoughts-on-bitcoin\n\n[4] http://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume\n\n[5] Speaking of dogecoin, as of this writing, it is the\nnumber 3 crytocurrency measured by daily volume, and if the market cap went up\n$10MM (about 25%), it would be the number 3 by market cap also."

        "正文": "Startup employees often do\nnot get treated very well when it comes to stock compensation.   New ideas float around occasionally, but\nlawyers are usually averse to trying new things, and investors don’t feel\nthat they have enough incentive to try something new for employees.\n\nThere are four major\nproblems: \n\n1) Employees usually don’t\nget enough stock. \n\n2) If an employee leaves\nthe company, he or she often can’t afford to exercise and pay taxes on their\noptions. \n\n3) Employee options\nsometimes get unfavorable tax treatment.\n\n4) Employees usually don’t have enough information about the stock or options. \n\nHere are some proposed\nsolutions:\n\n1) Startups should give\nemployees more stock.  Value is created\nover many, many years.  Founders\ncertainly deserve a huge premium for starting the earliest, but probably not\n100 or 200x what employee number 5 gets. \nAdditionally, companies can now get more done with less people.\n\nIt’s very difficult to put\nprecise numbers on this because the specifics of every situation matter so\nmuch.  Perhaps the best way to think\nabout it is to try to come up with a total compensation package with the same\nexpected value (using the company valuation of the last round, or a\nbest-efforts guess if it’s been a long time since the round) as the employee\nwould get at a big company like Google.  As an extremely rough stab at actual numbers,\nI think a company ought to be giving at least 10% in total to the first 10\nemployees, 5% to the next 20, and 5% to the next 50.  In practice, the optimal numbers may be much\nhigher.\n\nOne problem is that startups\ntry to have very small option pools after their A rounds, because the dilution\nonly comes from the founders and not the investors in most A-round term\nsheets.  The right thing to do would be\nto increase the size of the option pool post-A round, but unfortunately this\nrarely happens—no one wants to dilute themselves more, and this leads to\nshort-sighted stinginess much of the time.\n\nOption pools are complete\nfiction; boards can increase them whenever they want.  It should never be used as a reason for not\nmaking a grant.\n\n2) Most employees only\nhave 90 days after they leave a job to exercise their options.  Unfortunately, this requires money to cover\nthe strike price and the tax bill due for the year of exercise (which is\ncalculated on the difference between the strike and the current FMV).  This is often more cash than an employee has,\nand so the employee often has to choose between walking away from vested\noptions he or she can’t afford to exercise, or being locked into staying at the\ncompany.  It’s a particularly bad\nsituation when an employee gets terminated.\n\nThis doesn’t seem\nfair.  The best solution I have heard is\nfrom Adam D’Angelo at Quora.  The idea\nis to grant options that are exercisable for 10 years from the grant date, which should cover nearly all cases (i.e. the\ncompany will probably either go public, get acquired, or die in that time\nframe, and so either the employee will have the liquidity to exercise or it\nwon’t matter.)  There are\nsome tricky issues around this—for example, the options will automatically\nconvert from ISOs to NSOs 3 months after employment terminates (if applicable)\nbut it’s still far better than just losing the assets.  I think\nthis is a policy all startups should adopt.\n\nAs an aside, some\ncompanies now write in a repurchase right on vested shares at the current\ncommon price when an employee leaves. \nIt’s fine if the company wants to offer to repurchase the shares, but it’s\nhorrible for the company to be able to demand this.\n\n3) Tax treatment on ISOs\nsounds good, but there’s an issue with AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) and\nemployees often end up paying more tax than they were expecting.   NSO gains are taxed as ordinary income.  RSU gains are also taxed as ordinary income.\n\nTax optimization is a\nsecond-order issue, and for an immediate solution, I think extending exercise\nwindows to 10 years is the most important thing to do.  But longer-term, we should figure out a way\nfor employees to be taxed on their stock compensation the same way as founders\n(whether or not capital gains should be taxed less than ordinary income is a\nseparate discussion, but in any case I think the tax treatment should be the\nsame). \n\nI think this may be\ndoable.  Ideally, employees would just get\nrestricted stock (not RSUs), and then when they sold it’d be taxed as long-term\ncapital gains.  The problem is that as\nthe company grows, the stock has a non-trivial present value, and if an employee\nwere granted stock then they would then owe immediate tax on the value of the\ngrant.\n\nI think there are a lot of\nways to fix this.  The easiest would be\nif the IRS would agree to not tax illiquid private stock until it gets sold,\nand then tax the gain from the basis as long-term capital gains and the\noriginal value as ordinary income.\n\nAnother might be to create\na new class of employee stock.  Today, in\nan early-stage company, common shares are usually worth much less than\npreferred shares.  It might be possible\nto create a class of shares with less rights than common and thus worth even\nless.  The idea would be to convert these\nshares into common on an acquisition or IPO, but before that, they would be\nnon-transferable and have no value.  If\nit were possible to create a class of stock that the IRS agreed had next to\nzero value, it might be possible to grant employees this sort of stock, have\nthem owe a tiny bit of tax on it now, and then have normal long-term capital\ngains treatment years later when the startup goes public. \n\n4) Most startups do a bad\njob of helping employees think about the value of their options.  At a minimum, any startup should tell a\nprospective employee what percentage of the company the equity grant represents\n(number of shares is meaningless).  Some\nstartups are very hesitant to do this—they don’t want to disclose the number of\nshares outstanding.  Employees should\ndemand to know what percentage of the fully-diluted shares their stock options\nrepresent, and be very suspect of any startup that won’t tell them.\n\nA specific question worth\nasking is some version of “so if I have 0.5% of company and it gets acquired\ntomorrow for $100 million dollars, will I get $500,000?”  There are many ways for this not to be\nthe  case—there can be a huge liquidation\npreference, for example—that most employees don’t know to think about.  So it’s worth asking about a specific scenario.\n\nWhile you’re asking\nquestions, another good one to ask is “how much money did the company lose last\nmonth, and how much is in the bank?” \nThis is better than asking how much runway the company has, because\nmost founders calculate that off of a plan that assumes revenue growth which\ndoes not always materialize.\n\n \n\nI have two other thoughts\nabout stock-based compensation at startups.\n\nFirst, I think employee\nstock and options should usually not be transferrable.  It causes considerable problems for companies\nwhen employees sell their stock or options, or pledge them against a loan, or\ndesign any other transaction where they agree to potentially let someone else\nhave their shares or proceeds from their shares in the future in exchange for\nmoney today.\n\nI think it’s fair that if\nfounders sell stock, they should offer an opportunity to employees that have\nbeen at the company for more than a certain number of years to sell some\nportion of their shares.  And some\ncompanies offer an employee liquidity program even when the founders don’t sell\nany shares themselves.  But otherwise, I\nthink it’s reasonable for employees to wait for an acquisition or IPO.\n\nSecond, I think it’s time\nto consider other vesting ideas.  The\nstandard at startups is 4 years with a 1-year cliff.  So you get 25% of your options after you’ve\nbeen there for a year, and 62.5% if you leave after 2.5 years.\n\nIt’s possible that 4 years\nis now too short—companies are often worth more than they were 10 years ago,\nbut they take longer to reach liquidity. \nI’ve seen some startups offer 5 or 6 year vesting schedules.  To compensate for this, they offer above-market\ngrants.\n\nAnother structure I’ve\nseen is back-weighted vesting.  For\nexample, 10% of the grant vests after the first year, and then 20%, 30%, 40% in\nthe following years.  Again, the startups\nI know that do this tie it to above-market grants, and I think it helps them\nselect for employees that really believe in the company and want to be there\nfor a long time. (Also, companies that have vesting schedules like this usually\ndo it for founders too.)\n\nFinally, a third structure\nI’ve seen is a new way of thinking about refresher grants.  For a company using options, it’s nice to\ngrant employees options early while the strike is low.  It’s possible to give “forward-dated\ngrants”—i.e., you can give a high-performing employee a refresher grant today\nwhere 1/3 of it starts vesting immediately and the other 2/3 starts vesting\nwhen their initial grant is fully vested. \nThis guarantees them a low-strike price and presumably a relatively\nlarge grant in a few years.  Dustin\nMoskovitz at Asana does something like this, and I think it makes a lot of\nsense.\n\nThese are just a few of\nthe ideas I’ve seen about new ideas for employee vesting.  But I think they’re worth considering—the\ndefault 4-year grant does not seem to be the best option."

        "正文": "The YC\napplication deadline is this Friday, and you can apply here.\n\nPeople\noften tell us they think they want to start a company but just aren’t sure, so\nI thought I’d share some thoughts. \nAlthough it’s true that most people aren’t well suited to start\nstartups, a lot of people that could be great at it are afraid to make the\nleap.  They look at super successful founders who now seem impossibly impressive.\n\nThe first\ntime I met the Airbnb founders they were clearly smart and fairly impressive,\nbut nothing like what they are today.  We\nmet at a coffeeshop in Mountain View, and they were stumbling over their words\nand talking about how things weren’t going that well.  Now they are taking over the world.  This\nimprovement is not a special case—the same thing happened for the Collison\nbrothers at Stripe, and the founders of Homejoy, Weebly, Coinbase, Teespring,\nPebble, and on and on and on.\n\nHere’s\nthe secret: everyone starting a startup for the first time is scared, and\neveryone feels like a bit of an imposter.  Even the most successful\nfounders doubt themselves and their startups many times in the early days.  But founders improve very quickly.\n\nSo when\nyou’re thinking about whether or not you can start a startup, remember that you\nshouldn’t compare yourself to these people now.  They became much more\nimpressive in the course of running of their startup, and so can you.\n\nStarting a\nstartup is very hard and very painful.  Success usually requires a level\nof determination and commitment for which most people don’t have a mental\nmodel.\n\nFor\nexample, when Adora Cheung was starting Homejoy, she would work all day as a\ncleaner to learn the business, drive an hour back to Mountain View, stay up as\nlate as she could coding, then drive back to San Francisco at ~3am to beat\ntraffic, sleep in her car, and do it again.  She also gave both her\napartment and her car to early cleaners so that they could partner up with\nHomejoy.  We don’t want to delude anyone about what running a startup is\nlike—it’s a rational decision to decide you don’t want to start a\nstartup.  \n\nBut there\nare lots of great reasons to start a company, and a lot of people are willing\nto accept the pain. The unfortunate situation is when people who want to start\nstartups don’t actually get started—they feel like the great startup founders\nare too impressive, or they don’t know what to do, or it’s too risky.\n\nIt’s\nreally not that risky—in general, few things are as risky as they seem. \nAnd Y Combinator makes it even less risky—we don’t invest much money, but it’s\nenough to live on (even with a family in most cases).  If the startup\ndoesn’t work out, one of the advantages of the alumni network is that most YC\nfounders find something interesting to do next.\n\nThe only\nthing you have to know how to do is build something people want.  If you\ncan do this, and you are sufficiently relentless, you can probably create more\nvalue and have more impact than you could in a regular job.  YC can teach\nyou nearly everything else—in fact, most of what we do is give startups\none-on-one advice.\n\nFounders\nare usually amazed by how much they get done over the three months of YC, and\nhow much they change.  The structure of YC helps startups focus on the few\nthings that matter, and a group of people that mostly start out feeling like\nthey don’t belong transform to some of the best founders out there.\n\nIf you’re\nstill on the fence about applying for the Summer 2014 YC batch, we hope you’ll\nmake the leap!  And don’t worry if you’re not as far along as you’d like\nof if your application isn’t polished enough. \nWe’ve gotten very good at looking past this, and also it doesn’t hurt\nyou if you don’t get in the first time you apply (we rejected Drew Houston from\nDropbox the first time he applied).  We\nfund companies at all stages, from just the faintest idea to post-Series B. \n\nHere is\nsome advice other people have written about how to apply:\n\n\n\nHow to Apply to Y Combinator by Paul Graham\n\nLast Minute Advice for YC Applicants by Garry Tan\n\nHarj\nTaggar on Quora answering \"What is the best advice for a startup applying\nto Y Combinator?\"\n\nMichelle Crosby on her YC experience\n\nDrew Houston's Dropbox Application\n\nHarry Zhang's (Lob YC S13) Advice for YC Applicants \n\n Y Combinator Applicant Advice by Zain Shah"

        "正文": "On the whole, I got a great response\nto my request for feedback about how YC could encourage\nfemale founders.  It's clear there are two separate problems: \n\n1) Some women already starting\nstartups aren't interested in doing Y Combinator.\n\n2) Some women who could be great\nfounders don't start startups. \n\nI realize it's always a bit\nridiculous for a guy to talk about what it's like for female founders, but I'm\ninterested in doing whatever I can to help, because the\nventure business has definitely been unfair to women.  The women on our team also care deeply\nabout this issue, and  can do\nmore than I can to address it.\n\nFor point #1, one of the most\nconsistent messages was that we need to make it clear\nthat we care about the issue and want to fund more female founders.  So I'll\nsay that now: we want to fund more women.  And we'll keep\nsaying this in the outreach we do.\n\nWe want to fund more women because\nit's the right thing to do, but we're not doing this for diversity's sake\nalone.  We want to fund more women because we are greedy in the good\nway--we want to fund the most successful startups, and many of those\nare going to be founded by women.\n\nMany are also going to be founded by\npeople of different races, different religions, from different countries,\nstraight, gay, in their 20s, or in their 50s.  All of those apply to\npeople in the current YC batch.  In fact, they all apply to the YC\npartnership as well.  Again, we don't do this for the sake of diversity.\nWe do it because we want to get the best people, whatever\nthey're like.\n\nIn the current YC batch, 24% of the\ncompanies we funded have one or more female founders, and there will be a lot\nof companies out of those with the potential to serve as role models.  We hope that as the number of female YC alumni continues to rise, more women\nwill feel YC is a place that supports and respects them.\n\nAnother message was that we should do\nmore to make women feel welcome.  Many emails pointed out that our website\nshows nearly all men; we'll fix that.  We'll also continue to work with\nour most successful female founders to talk about their experiences\nand mentor women that could be future founders.  We'll\ncontinue to ask women to come speak at dinners. In\nthis batch, two of my four favorite speakers were women\n(Adora Cheung and Julia Hartz).  And we're working on something to improve\nthe quality of Hacker News comments.\n\nA very common request was for us to\nhave women in the interviews we do before funding companies.  In the last\nbatch, we had a woman in 2 of the 3 interview tracks.  We now have more\nfemale YC partners, so for this upcoming batch, we'll have a woman in every\ntrack.\n\nNearly all women who emailed me\nsuggested that we keep the exact same bar for women as for men (anything else\nwouldn't be fair to the incredible women we fund every batch), but many pointed\nout that women are often good in different ways and at different things than men--for example, that men and women express confidence differently--and that we should make\nsure our criteria catch that.\n\nA specific issue that came up is a\nbelief that we look for founders that look like Mark\nZuckerberg.  Actually that meme began as a self-deprecating joke. We funded a guy once who looked like Mark but ended up doing badly, and when PG\nwas asked by a reporter how to fool him,\nhe said that apparently this was one way. His real point was that looking like\nZuckerberg means nothing--that you can look remarkably like him and still fail miserably.  I think it's more\naccurate to say we look for founders that have some of the qualities that have\nmade Zuckerberg so successful.\n\nFinally, I heard a lot of support for\nevents like the Female Founders Conference and a belief that they\ncould help change the industry.  And if\nYC continues to fund more women, many people believe VCs will follow.\n\nFor point #2, I think we can do a lot\nto reach young women earlier and help teach them about\nstartups and coding.  Many women pointed out that\nyou don't have to be a coder to be a founder.  That's definitely true, and\nit was a good reminder for me personally.  But I think it's good to at\nleast present learning to code as an option worth considering.\n\nAs we do more events, we'll continue\nto reach out to women.  Kat, our director of outreach,\nJessica, our founding partner, and I will all specifically\nwork on this.  For example, we're thinking about holding a hackathon later this year.  It'd be great to have\na lot of women attend.\n\nWe're also going to ask some of our\nsuccessful female founders to do more outreach.  I believe we have already\nfunded at least one female founder/CEO who will produce a\nmultibillion dollar company. She and others are outstanding\nrole models.\n\nThere's lots of work still to do, but\nwe're on it.  I hope other investors will join us."

        "正文": "We’d like for Y Combinator to\nfund more breakthrough technology companies—companies that solve an important\nproblem, have a very long time horizon, and are based on an underlying\ntechnological or scientific breakthrough. \nNot many people try to start these companies, so starting a company that\nwill require a huge amount of time and money is an automatic competitive\nadvantage.  SpaceX and Tesla are great\nexamples of what is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt used to be the case\nthat governments funded a lot of development of breakthrough technologies.  The bad news is that they have mostly\nstopped; the good news is that the leverage of technology is such that now\nsmall startups can do what used to take the resources of nations. [1]\n\nWe think the YC model\nworks well for these companies.  We\ninvest with infinite time horizon and are not afraid of risky-looking\ncompanies. [2] We understand software, which will be central to many of these\ncompanies.  We are good at getting\ncompanies to focus on solving real problems for real customers, and not just\ndeveloping technology for its own sake.  And\nour model helps companies figure out a right-sized initial project achievable\nwith a small amount of time and money—great companies get built with a series\nof small wins that compound over time, and early momentum is critical.  A common failure mode of many ambitious\ncompanies is to bite off an initial project that is far too big and\nexpensive.  Finally, we know a lot about\nraising money, which will be a big part of the challenge for many of these\ncompanies as they mature.\n\nHere is a list (we’ll\nadd to it over time) of some areas we’re particularly interested in, but more\ngenerally, we’ll pay attention to any area where technology can make the world\nmuch better.\n\nEnergy.  There is a remarkable correlation between the\ncost of energy and quality of life. \nThroughout history, when the cost of energy has come down a lot (for\nexample, with the steam engine) the quality of life goes up a lot.\n\nCheap energy would\ndo a huge amount to reduce poverty.  New\nenergy sources could also help the environment, the economy, reduce war, ensure\na stable future, make food and water more abundant, and much more.\n\nWe believe economics\nwill dominate—new sources must be cheaper than old ones, without subsidies, and\nbe able to scale to global demand.\n\nNuclear energy can hit\nthe bid, and possibly so can renewables. \nBut pricing is the first order question.\n\nIn addition to\ngeneration, we’re also interested in energy storage and transmission.  10x better batteries would enable great new\nthings, as would the ability to easily move energy around. \n\nAI. Relative\nto the potential impact, it doesn’t seem like enough smart people are\nworking on this.\n\nA lot of smart people\ntalk about AI with a combination of awe and fear, both for good reasons.  But it feels like it could be one of the\ndividing lines in the history of technology, where before and after look\ntotally different.\n\nRobotics. Robots will be a major way we get things done in the physical\nworld.  Our definition is pretty broad—for\nexample, we count a self-driving car as a robot.  Robots are how we’ll likely explore space and\nmaybe even the human body.\n\nBiotech.\nIt’s still early, but it seems like we’re finally making real progress hacking\nbiology.  There are so many directions this\ncan go—fighting disease, slowing aging, merging humans and computers,\ndownloading memories, genetic programming, etc.   We are certain that this is going to be a\nsurprising, powerful and controversial field over the next several decades—it\nfeels a little bit like microcomputers in the 1970s. \n\nHealthcare. Healthcare in the United States is badly broken.  We are getting close to spending 20% of our GDP\non healthcare; this is unsustainable.\n\nWe’re interested in ways\nto make healthcare better for less money, not in companies that are able to\nexploit the system by overcharging. \nWe’re especially interested in preventative healthcare, as this is\nprobably the highest-leverage way to improve health.  Sensors and data are interesting in lots of\ndifferent areas, but especially for healthcare.\n\nFood and water. At some point, we are going to have problems with food and water\navailability.  Technology can almost\ncertainly improve this.  Great\ninnovations are possible—we will need another advancement on the scale of what\nNorman Borlaug did. \n\nEducation. If we can fix education, we can eventually do everything else on\nthis list.  The first attempts to use\ntechnology to fix education have focused on using the Internet to distribute traditional\ncontent to a wider audience.  This is\ngood, but the Internet is a fundamentally different medium and capable of much\nmore.\n\nSolutions that combine\nthe mass scale of technology with one-on-one in-person interaction are\nparticularly interesting to us.\n\nThis may not require a\n“breakthrough technology” in the classical sense, but at a minimum it will\nrequire very new ways of doing things. \n\nInternet Infrastructure.  We can’t\nimagine life without the Internet.  We\nneed to be sure it keeps working—this includes everything from security to free\nand open communication to infrastructure. \nThe Internet is a transformative power, and we’re particularly\ninterested in applications that transform the big underpinnings of society\n(bitcoin is a great example!).  The\nInternet lets people around the world coordinate action—there are almost\ncertainly important businesses to be built around this concept.\n\nOf particular interest\nto us are ways to use the Internet to fix government—for example, crowdfunding\nsocial services.\n\nAn important trend is\nthe API-ification of everything.  As more\nand more businesses are accessible with a web API, the Internet becomes more\nand more powerful. \n\nLevers.  We’re interested in\ntechnology that multiplies the efforts and productivity of individuals. \nRobots are a great example, but this also includes areas like new programming\nlanguages, powered exoskeletons, augmented reality, etc.\n\nScience.\n Science seems broken.  The current funding models are broken and\nfavor political skill over scientific genius. \nWe need new business models for basic research.  There are a lot of areas where scientific\ndevelopments can have huge commercial applications—materials, neuroscience,\nclimate engineering, and cheaper/better ways to get to space, just to name a\nfew—and we’d love to figure out a way for it to happen.  Bell Labs worked a long time ago but would\nprobably not work in today’s world.\n\nTransportation and housing.  About\nhalf of all energy is used on transportation, and people spend a huge amount of\ntime unhappily commuting.  Face-to-face\ninteraction is still really important; people still need to move around.  And housing continues to get more expensive,\npartially due to difficulties in transportation.  We’re interested in better ways for people to\nlive somewhere nice, work together, and have easier commutes.\n\nAs a side note, you\nshouldn’t start a company just because it’s on this list.  Our hope is that someone already working on a\ncompany in one of these areas that might not have otherwise applied to YC will\nnow consider it.  The great majority of\nthe startups we fund will continue to be the sort of Internet and mobile\ncompanies we’ve funded in the past, so if that’s what you wanted to do before\nthis post, keep doing it.  Traditional-looking\nstartups like Google and Facebook are obviously as important as any company one\ncould imagine, and clearly are breakthrough technologies. \n\n[1] To be clear, we are\nnot interested in funding patent trolls. \nWe only want to fund businesses that actually solve problems and create\nvalue. \n\n[2] Related to long time\nhorizons, if a company needs to raise a billion dollars of funding over the\ncourse of its life, that doesn’t scare us—in fact, that’s a plus."

        "正文": "There’s a lot written about what you should do when you raise money, but there hasn’t been as much written about the common mistakes founders make. Here is a list of mistakes I often see: \n• Over-optimizing the process\nA lot of founders try to get way too fancy with tricks that they think will help them raise money.  It’s actually quite simple; if you have a good company, you will probably be able to raise money.  You’re better off working to make you company better than working on fundraising jiu jitsu. The process is simple:\nGet intros to investors you want to talk to and reach out to them, in parallel, not in series - this is important, see (3).\nExplain to them why your company is likely to make them a lot of money. This usually includes the company’s mission, the product, current traction, future vision, the market, the competition, why you’re going to win, what the long-term competitive advantage will be, how you’re going to make money, and the team.\nSet up a competitive environment. You'll (unsurprisingly) get the best terms when multiple investors compete with one another for space in your round.  This is the one rule of \"the game\" that is really important--I'll talk about it more later on.\nSome founders try things like carefully timing news articles, casually mentioning to one investor that they'll be having dinner with another investor, claiming their schedule is really packed except for one specific hour, and other tricks - but if you just build a good company, you generally won’t need to. Many little things simply don't matter very much--for example, the \"signal\" sent when an early investor chooses not to participate in a later round. If the company is doing well stuff like this is easily overlooked, and if the company's not doing it will struggle to raise money anyway. Unless you do it perfectly, game-playing will hurt you with most good investors. And you should be trustworthy and honest no matter what. Investors won't back you if they can't trust you. \n• Over-optimizing the terms\nStartups are usually a pass-fail course -- either you succeed or you don't.  If you fail, maybe you get acqui-hired, but that's happening less frequently and is usually little better than just getting a job at the acquiring company instead. The important thing is to get good investors, clean terms, and not spend too much time fundraising. The biggest problem comes from chasing high valuations. Contrary to what many people think, at YC we encourage companies to seek out reasonable valuations. Valuations are something quantitative for founders to measure themselves on, and there are lots of investors willing to pay high prices, so they don’t always listen. But I’ll say it again: trying to get really high valuations is a mistake.If you’re clearly in a position of leverage, it’s fine to push for a high valuation, but don’t jerk investors around. Just say what you want and don’t get into a lot of back and forth or term complexity. Also remember that very high valuations often push out good investors. And don’t forget the prime directive of fundraising strategy: set things up so that you never do a down round. The badness of a down round is difficult to overstate; in fact, the threat of that is the best reason not to take a super high price when you’re offered one.  If you raise at such a price, everything has to go perfectly in order for your next round to be an up one. \n• Failing to create a competitive environment\nOk, here is the one part of the game I really believe is critical.  You generally need to set up a competitive environment to get a good outcome in fundraising (or, for that matter, any big deal). The hard part is getting the first offer. Once you have this, you have the leverage -- if other investors don’t act fast, you have an offer you can take, and they risk missing a potentially great opportunity (and maybe looking stupid to their partners, etc etc.) Until then, they can procrastinate and wait as long as they want. It’s remarkable how long it can take the first offer to come in, and how quickly the next ten can materialize. So sometimes you have the hack the process a little bit to get this first offer. The best way is to find someone who loves what you’re doing and is willing to act. Although it’s ok to use that offer to get others, you should be nice to anyone willing to act first by prioritizing their offer, finding a way to get them into the round even if someone else leads it, etc. There are a lot of other tactics for this that I should write a separate post on at some point. Beware, though, that saying things like “our round is closing really fast” when you have no offers usually backfires. Investors talk and will call your bluff. When you have a good competitive environment the leverage shifts to you - you will be astonished at how much things change. Firms that previously couldn’t meet you for three weeks will suddenly be able to schedule full partner meetings on a Sunday. And when multiple bidders really want to invest, a lot of the \"non-negotiable\" terms like 20% ownership and board seats go away. \n• Coming across as arrogant, antagonistic, disrespectful, etc.\nSomehow, a myth got started that investors like this and nerdy founders sometimes put on an affectation.  Don’t do it.  Be respectful (which includes things like not asking investors to make a decision after a first meeting unless you really are about to close your round). Remember that investors are people too. They want to feel loved. The first time I raised money, I was hesitant to tell the investors I really liked that I really liked them because I thought I was giving up leverage. But it turns out telling the investors you really like that you especially want to work with them makes them more positively inclined to you, not less. \n• Not hearing no\nInvestors don’t want to kill option value; founders are optimistic people.  This leads to investors saying a very nice version of \"no\" and founders hearing \"with just a few more conversations, I may get to a yes.\"  Anything other than a term sheet is a \"no\", and all the reasons don’t matter.  Move on and talk to other investors. \n• Not having a lead investor\nA lot of founders put together party rounds comprised of dozens of investors and congratulate themselves that no single investor has much power over them.  But in practice investors have little power over companies that are doing well anyway, and what they actually have is no investor that is super invested in their success. It turns out it’s really valuable to have one investor that you meet with every month and report progress to. This forcing function creates an operational cadence in the company that is a big net positive. It’s remarkable to me how much more frequently the party round companies go off into the weeds. \n• Pitching poorly\nA lot of founders get caught up in trying to follow a perfect template, and drone on and on about their competitors, the market evolution, etc.  They’re bored and it shows. The way to pitch well is to focus on the parts of the business that truly excite you. That will shine through, and it will get the investors excited. Conveying your passion for the business is almost as important as what you say, and it’s almost impossible to fake. Even if you’re an introvert, it will usually come through to a sophisticated investor. So start with the parts you’re really excited about. Investors want to hear a good story, and that includes things like how you decided to work on this idea, why it matters, how you met your cofounders, etc. So don’t leave those parts out of the pitch. Also, remember that smart investors are looking for the really big hits. So don’t do obviously dumb things like talk about potential acquirers in a seed round pitch - that will suggest you’re not trying to build a really big company.• Not reference-checking major investorsGreat investors can add a huge amount of value; bad investors can make your life miserable.  Before signing up to work with someone for the better part of a decade, spend an hour calling founders they have worked with to get a sense of what's in store for you. \n• Lacking a clear vision\nIf you don’t seem to have any strong feelings or conviction, and you agree with every suggestion the investor makes about your business, you'll risk coming across as lacking a clear vision.  You should always listen to what someone smart has to say, but you should be firm on the things you really believe. Founders with a clear vision can usually explain what they’re doing and why it matters in just a handful of words. Clear vision also usually entails at least one big new idea. Even if it’s a familiar problem, there should be something important the investor hasn’t heard before. It’s ok to have some big unknowns, of course. You’re not expected to have all the answers, but you should have clear theses to start with. \n• Not knowing key metrics\nThere are two questions I really look at in early stage investments:\nDoes the team know what to do?\nCan the team do it?\nThe first question is addressed by the bullet point above.  The second is addressed by showing that the team cares about operational quality.  I’ve found that teams that execute well always know their numbers (or current status if in R+D mode) cold, and that it’s one of the best predictors of execution quality.  It’s surprising how many companies pitch investors without knowing this information."

        "正文": "Yesterday at lunch a friend asked me what tech trend he should pay attention to but was probably ignoring.Without thinking much I said “artificial intelligence”, but having thought about that a bit more, I think it’s probably right. To be clear, AI (under the common scientific definition) likely won’t work. You can say that about any new technology, and it’s a generally correct statement. But I think most people are far too pessimistic about its chances - AI has not worked for so long that it’s acquired a bad reputation. CS professors mention it with a smirk. Neural networks failed the first time around, the logic goes, and so they won’t work this time either. But artificial general intelligence might work, and if it does, it will be the biggest development in technology ever.I’d argue we’ve gotten closer in lots of specific domains - for example, computers are now better than humans at lots of impressive things like playing chess and flying airplanes. But rather than call these examples of AIs, we just say that they weren’t really that hard in the first place.  And to be fair, none of these really feel anything like a computer that can think like a human. There are a number of private (or recently acquired) companies, plus some large public ones, that are making impressive progress towards artificial general intelligence, but the good ones are very secretive about it.There are certainly some reasons to be optimistic. Andrew Ng, who worked or works on Google’s AI, has said that he believes learning comes from a single algorithm - the part of your brain that processes input from your ears is also capable of learning to process input from your eyes. If we can just figure out this one general-purpose algorithm, programs may be able to learn general-purpose things. There have been promising early results published from this sort of work, but because the brain is such a complex system so dependent on emergent behavior it’s difficult to say how close to the goal we really are. We understand how individual neurons work pretty well, and it’s possible that’s all we need to know to model how intelligence works. But the emergent behavior of 100 billion of them working together on the same principles gets extraordinarily complex, and difficult to model in software. Or, as Nick Sivo says, \"it's like reverse engineering the latest Intel processor with only the basic knowledge of how a transistor works.\"  It’s also possible that there’s some other phenomenon responsible for intelligence, and the people working on this are on the wrong track.The biggest question for me is not about artificial intelligence, but instead about artificial consciousness, or creativity, or desire, or whatever you want to call it. I am quite confident that we’ll be able to make computer programs that perform specific complex tasks very well. But how do we make a computer program that decides what it wants to do? How do we make a computer decide to care on its own about learning to drive a car? Or write a novel? It’s possible--probable, even--that this sort of creativity will be an emergent property of learning in some non-intuitive way. Something happened in the course of evolution to make the human brain different from the reptile brain, which is closer to a computer that plays pong. (I originally was going to say a computer that plays chess, but computers play chess with no intuition or instinct--they just search a gigantic solution space very quickly.)And maybe we don't want to build machines that are concious in this sense.  The most positive outcome I can think of is one where computers get really good at doing, and humans get really good at thinking.  If we never figure out how to make computers creative, then there will be a very natural division of labor between man and machine."

        "正文": "For most startups in the bay area, the engineer crunch is a bigger problem than the Series A crunch (this somewhat applies to designers as well, but most startups need far more developers than designers). The difference in difficulty between hiring developers and hiring everyone else is remarkable--I frequently hear startups say that for a non-engineering position they can find multiple great candidates without really looking but can't find a single great candidate for an engineering role no matter how hard they look. Sometimes this difficulty is self-inflicted. First, of all the canonical terrible advice investors give, being cheap with equity grants is among the worst. I’m not quite sure why so many investors (and some founders) get this so wrong, but when startups complain about being unable to hire engineers and in the next breath tell me they are offering 0.1% to 0.2% as a very early stage company, I lose a lot of sympathy fast. Granting equity should be easy to do. If someone performs and earns their grant over four years, they are likely to increase the value of the company far more than the 1% or whatever you give them. If you’ve made a hiring mistake, you ought to fire them well before they hit their cliff anyway. I have never seen a startup regret being generous with equity for their early employees. I have seen a lot of failed startups proud of how well they managed their option pool budgeting. For most engineers, this is as much about fairness and feeling valued as it is about the money. And of course, if people are going to turn down the certainty of a huge salary at Google, they should get a reward for taking that risk. On the positive side, average equity grants for engineers at early stage companies seem to be moving up, but still not as much as they should given the supply/demand mechanics. Second, I've noticed that mission-oriented companies have a much easier time recruiting engineers. It’s a cliché that great engineers want to change the world, but it’s generally true. If the best part of your recruiting pitch is about how much money the company is going to make, you’ll have a harder time recruiting talent than if you can talk about why it’s so critical for the world that your startup fulfills its mission. That said, if you’re the 17th food delivery startup, don’t make up some story about how you’re going to change the world--it won’t work.  You can still find ways to hire great people, but an embellished mission isn't one of them. Great hackers also want the opportunity to work with really smart people and the opportunity to work on interesting problems, and the nature of mission-oriented companies is such that they usually end up offering these as well. If you are not a mission-oriented company, then I think the best strategy is to think about how to make do with a much smaller engineering team than you might have originally wanted. Teams of two or three engineers can accomplish amazing things, and there are plenty of great businesses that need small engineering teams and very large operations/sales teams. Also, in this case, you pretty much have to have a hacker cofounder, because hiring good developers will be so hard. Third, if you’re going to recruit outside of your network (usually a mistake, but sometimes there are truly no other options), focus on recruiting outside of the valley. There are great hackers all over the country, and many of them can be talked into moving to the valley. In fact, probably less than 5% of the best hackers are even in the United States. [1]Finally, most founders are not willing to spend the time it takes to source engineering candidates and convince them to come interview.  You can't outsource this to a recruiter until the company is fairly well-established--you have to do it yourself. [1] Every time someone from the government asks me what they can do to help startups, I always say a version of “The only thing you need to do is fix immigration for founders and engineers. This will likely have far more of an impact than all of the government innovation programs put together.”"

        "正文": "Thanks to technology, people can create more wealth now than ever\nbefore, and in twenty years they’ll be able to create more wealth than they can\ntoday.  Even though this leads to more\ntotal wealth, it skews it toward fewer people. \nThis disparity has probably been growing since the beginning of\ntechnology, in the broadest sense of the word.\n\nTechnology makes wealth inequality worse by giving people leverage and\ncompounding differences in ability and amount of work.  It also often replaces human jobs with machines.  A long time ago, differences in ability and\nwork ethic had a linear effect on wealth; now it’s exponential. [1] Technology\nleads to increasing wealth inequality for lots of other reasons, too—for\nexample, it makes it much easier to reach large audiences all at once, and a\ngreat product can be sold immediately worldwide instead of in just one area.\n\nWithout intervention, technology will probably lead to an untenable\ndisparity—so we probably need some amount of intervention.  Technology also increases the total wealth in\na way that mostly benefits everyone, but at some point the disparity just feels\nso unfair it doesn’t matter.And critically, without a reasonable baseline of access to wealth, there can be no such thing as equality of opportunity.\n\nWealth inequality today in the United States is extreme and growing,\nand we talk about it a lot when someone throws a brick through the window of a\nGoogle bus.  Lots of smart people have\nalready written about this, but here are two images to quickly show what the\nskew looks like:         \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n[0]\n\nAs the following table shows, wealth inequality has been growing in America for some time, not just the last few years.  It’s noticeable between the top 20% and bottom 80%, and particularly noticeable between the top 1% and bottom 99%.\n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nAnd here is a graph that shows the income share of the top 1% over\ntime:        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nThe best thing one can probably say about this widening inequality is\nthat it means we are making technological progress—if it were not happening,\nsomething would be going wrong with innovation. \nBut it’s a problem for obvious reasons (and the traditional endings to\nextreme wealth inequality in a society are never good).\n\nWe are becoming a nation of haves and have-nots—of prosperous San\nFrancisco vs. bankrupt Detroit.  In San\nFrancisco, the average house costs around $1mm.  In Detroit, the average house costs less than\na Chevy Malibu made there. [2] And yet, I’d view a $1mm house in San Francisco\nas a better investment than 20 $50k houses in Detroit.  As the relentless march of technology\ncontinues, whole classes of jobs lost are never coming back, and cities\ndependent on those lost jobs are in bad shape. [3]\n\nThis widening wealth divide is happening at all levels—people,\ncompanies, and countries.  And either it\nwill keep going, or innovation will stop.\n\nBut it feels really unfair. \nPeople seem to be more sensitive to relative economic status than\nabsolute.  So even if people are much\nbetter off being poor today than king 500 years ago, most people compare\nthemselves to the richest people today, and not the richest people from the\npast.\n\nAnd importantly, it really is unfair. \nTrying to live on minimum wage in the United States is atrocious (http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonalds-employee-budget-has-everyone-up-in-arms/).  That budget, incidentally, assumes that the\nworker is working two jobs.  Even though they’re\noutputting less value, that person is certainly working harder than I am.  We should do more to help people like this.\n\nReal minimum wage has declined, failing to track real averages wages\nand massively failing to track the wages of the top 1%.\n\n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nIn a world where ideas and networks are what matter, and manufacturing\ncosts trend towards zero, we are going to have to get comfortable with a smaller\nand smaller number of people creating more and more of the wealth.   And we need a new solution for the people\nnot creating most of the wealth—many of the minimum wage jobs are going to get\ninnovated away anyway.\n\nThere are no obvious/easy solutions, or this would all be\nresolved.  I don’t have any great\nanswers, so I’ll just throw out some thoughts.\n\nWe should assume that computers will replace effectively all\nmanufacturing, and also most “rote work” of any kind.  So we have to figure out what humans are\nbetter at than computers.  If really\ngreat AI comes along, all bets are off, but at least for now, humans still have\nthe market cornered on new ideas.   In an\nideal world, we’d divide labor among humans and computer so that we can both\nfocus on what we’re good at. \n\nThere is reason to be optimistic.   When the steam engine came along, a lot of\npeople lost their manual labor jobs.  But\nthey found other things to do.  And when\nfactories came along, the picture looked much worse.   And yet, again, we found new kinds of jobs.  This time around, we may see lots more\nprogrammers and startups.\n\nBetter education—in the right areas—is probably the best way to solve this.  I am skeptical of many current education\nstartups, but I do believe this is a solvable problem.  A rapid change in what and how we teach\npeople is critical—if everything is changing, we cannot keep the same model for\neducation and expect it to continue to work. \nIf large classes of jobs get eliminated, hopefully we can teach people\nnew skills and encourage them to do new things. \n\nEducation, unlike a lot of other government spending, is actually an\ninvestment—we ought to get an ROI on it in terms of increased GDP (but of\ncourse it takes a long time to pay back). \n\nHowever, if we cannot find a new kind of work for billions of people,\nwe’ll be faced with a new idle class.  The\nobvious conclusion is that the government will just have to give these people\nmoney, and there’s been increasing talk about a “basic income”—i.e, any adult\nwho wanted it could have, say, $15,000 a year.\n\nYou can run the numbers in a way that sort of makes sense—if we did\nthis for every adult in the US, it’d be about $3.5 trillion a year, or a little\nmore than 20% of our GDP.  However, we’d\nknock out a lot of existing entitlement spending, maybe 10% of GDP.  And we’d probably phase it out for people\nmaking over a certain threshold, which could cut it substantially. \n\nThere are benefits to this—we’d end up helping truly poor people more\nand middle class people less, and we’d presumably cut a ton of government\nbureaucracy.  We could perhaps end\npoverty overnight (although, no doubt, anything like this would cause prices to\nrise).  And likely most of this money\nwould be spent, providing some boost to the economy.  We could require 10 hours a week of work for\nthe government, or not.  A big problem\nwith this strategy is that I don’t think it’ll do much to address the feeling\nof inequality.\n\nMany people have a visceral dislike to the idea of giving away money\n(though I think some redistribution of wealth is required to reasonably\nequalize opportunity), and certainly the default worry is that people would\njust sit around and waste time on the Internet. \nBut maybe, if everyone knew they had a safety net, we’d get more\nstartups, or more new research, or more novels. \nEven if only a small percentage of people were productive, in a world\nwhere some people create 10,000x more value than others, that’d be ok.  The main point I’m trying to make is that\nwe’re likely going to have to do something new and uncomfortable, and we should\nbe open to any new ideas.\n\nBut this still doesn’t address the fundamental issue—I believe most\npeople want to be productive.  And I\nthink figuring out a much better way to teach a lot more people about\ntechnology is likely the best way to make that happen.\n\n\nThanks to Nick Sivo for reading a draft of this.\nFollow me on Twitter here: http://twitter.com/sama\n\n[0] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM\n[1] There are lots of other significant factors that cause wealth inequality—for example, having money makes it easier to make more money—but technology is an important and often-overlooked piece\n[2] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/home-cost_n_1690109.html\n[3] I was recently in Detroit and was curious to see some of the neighborhoods where you can buy houses for $10-20k.  Here are some pictures:\n\n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n

[2]\n\nIf you’re reading this and feeling unproductive, there’s a\nsilver lining.  You can just close the\nbrowser window.  The good news is that it’s easy to course-correct, and it feels great.\n\n\n\n[1] I count blogging as a marginal use of time, but the\nreason I started is because I realized it was important to be good at writing,\nI was bad at it, and the only way I was going to improve was with lots of\npractice.  And sometimes I meet really\ninteresting founders because of something I wrote.\n\n[2] This isn’t meant as any sort of relative value judgment;\nif what you want to do is build an enterprise software company, then you should\ndo that.  The problem comes when what you\nreally want to do is build rockets.  A\nlot of people feel like they first should do something to make money and then\ndo what they care about (or first work at a company for awhile before starting\na company they really want to start). \nWhile you of course should take care of your family before anything\nelse, you should try to work on what you really care about.  You can usually find a way.  The danger is that life is short and you only\nget to work on a small number of companies over the course of a career—it’s\nworth trying to make them count."

        "正文": "I spent some time recently thinking about what companies that grow up to be extremely successful do when they are very young. I came up with the following list. It’s from personal experience and I’m sure there are plenty of exceptions. While plenty of non-successful startups do some of these things too, I think there is value in trying to match the patterns. *They are obsessed with the quality of the product/experience. Almost a little too obsessed—they spend a lot of time on details that at first glance wouldn’t seem to be really important.  The founders of these companies react as if they feel physical pain when something isn’t quite right with the product or a user has a bad customer support experience. Although they believe in launching early and iterating, they generally won't release something crappy. (This is not an excuse to launch slowly.  You're probably taking too long to launch.)As part of this, they don't put anyone between the founders and the users.  The founders of these companies do things like sales and customer support themselves. *They are obsessed with talent. The founders take great pride in the quality of their team and do whatever it takes to get the best people to join them.  Everyone says they only want to hire the best people, but the best founders don't compromise on this point.  If they do make a hiring mistake, they fix it very quickly.And they hire very slowly.  They don't get any thrill out of having employees for its own sake, and they do the dirty work themselves at the beginning.As part of this, they really focus on getting the culture of the company right.\n*They can explain the vision for the company in a few clear words. This is most striking in contrast to companies that require multiple complicated sentences to explain, which never seem to do really well.  Also, they can articulate why they're going to succeed even if others going after the problem have failed, and they have a clear insight about why their market is a great one.More generally, they communicate very well.\n*They generate revenue very early on in their lives.  Often as soon as they get their first user.\n*They are tough and calm.  Founders of great companies are always tough and unflappable.  Every startup seems like it's going to die--sometimes multiple times in a single day--and founders of really successful companies just seem to pull out a gun and shoot the villain without losing their train of thought.Formidableness can be developed; I've seen weak-seeming founders grow into it fast.\n*They keep expenses low.  In addition to hiring slowly, they start off very frugal. Interestingly, the companies that don't do this (and usually fail) often justify it by saying \"we're thinking really big\".  After everything is working really well, they will sometimes ramp up expenses a lot but manage to still only spend where it matters.\n*They make something a small number of users really love. Paul Buchheit was the first person I ever heard point this out, but it's really true.  Successful startups nearly always start with an initial core of super happy users that become very dependent on their product, and then expand from there.  The strategy of something that starts with something a huge number of people sort of like empirically does not work as well.\n*They grow organically.  And they are generally skeptical of inorganic strategies like big partnership deals and to a lesser extent PR.  They certainly don't have huge press events to launch their startup.  Mediocre founders focus on big PR launches to answer their growth prayers. \n*They are focused on growth. The founders always know their user and revenue numbers.  There’s never any hesitation when you ask them.  They have targets they are trying to hit for the next week, month, and year. *They balance a focus on growth with strategic thinking about the future.   They have clear plans and strong opinions about what they're going to build that no one can talk them out of.  But they focus more on execution in the moment than building out multi-year strategic plans.Another way this trait shows itself is \"right-sized\" first projects.  You can't go from zero to huge; you have to find something not too big and not too small to build first.  They seem to have an innate talent for figuring out right-sized projects.\n*They do things that don't scale.  Paul Graham has written about this.  The best founders take it unusually far.\n*They have a whatever-it-takes attitude. There are some things about running a startup that are not fun.  Mediocre founders try to hire people for the parts that they don't like.  Great founders just do whatever they think is in the best interest of the company, even if they're not \"passionate\" about that part of the business.\n*They prioritize well.  In any given day there are 100 reasonable things that you could work on.  It's easy to get pulled into a fire on number 7, or even to spend time at a networking event or something like that that probably ranks in the mid-90s.  The founders that are really successful are relentless about making sure they get to their top two or three priorities each day (as part of this, they figure out what the right priorities are), and ignoring other items.\n*The founders are nice.  I'm sure this doesn't always apply, but the most successful founders I know are nicer than average.  They're tough, they're very competitive, and they are ruthless, but they are fundamentally nice people.\n*They don't get excited about pretending to run a startup.  They care about being successful, not going through the motions to look successful.  They get no thrill from having a 'real' company; they don't spend a lot of time interviewing lawyers and accountants or going to network events or anything like that.  They want to win and don't care much about how they look doing so.One reason that this is super important is that they are willing to work on things that seem trivial, like a website that lets you stay on an air mattress in someone's house.  Most of the best ideas seem like bad ideas when they start, and if you're more into appearance than substance, you won't want people laughing at you.  You are far better off starting a company that people laugh at but keeps growing relentlessly than a company with a beautiful office that seems serious but is always two quarters away from starting its growth ramp.\n*They get stuff done. Mediocre founders spend a lot of time talking about grand plans; the best founders may be working on things that seem small but get them done extraordinarily quickly.  Every time you talk to them, they've gotten a few new things done.  Even if they're working on big projects, they get small chunks done incrementally and have demonstratable progress--they never disappear for a year and jump from nothing to a huge project being completed.  And they're reliable--if they tell you they'll do something, it happens.\n*They move fast. They make quick decisions on everything.  They respond to emails quickly.  This is one of the most striking differences between great and mediocre founders.  Great founders are execution machines."

        "正文": "Most of the time, we worry far too much about tail risk.We worry about terrorist attacks and necrotizing fasciitis, but not much about heart disease or car crashes.  But in 2011, 17 US citizens worldwide died as a result of terrorism and approximately 150 from necrotizing fasciitis. There were nearly 600,000 deaths resulting from heart disease and over 32,000 from car crashes. Based on current data, you are about 35,000 times more likely to die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack.  So everyone smart says that we worry about terrorism way too much, and so far, they’ve been right. For whatever reason, we seem to be wired to overweight the risk of the dramatic, scary, but very unlikely and underweight the risk of the mundane, familiar, and probable.But maybe there are some tail risks we should really worry about. Our risk-evaluation miscalibration leads to important blind spots. We’ve seen images of a nuclear explosion; we know how terrifying that is, and so we fear it. Most people have had the flu, and so we don’t fear that—we know it’s possible to die from the flu, but most people don’t.  Death from the flu doesn't trigger most peoples' panic sensors because the version of it we know is boring and familiar. However, I don’t think we have collectively thought enough about how biotechnology is going to change the landscape. Of all “technologies\", it’s the one thing that really scares me. [1] Biotech has incredible potential to improve our lives, probably even more so than computers, but of course that comes with much graver downside. Also in 2011, some researchers figured out how to reengineer H5N1—avian influenza virus—to make it much scarier by causing five mutations at the same time that all together made the virus both easy to spread and quite lethal. These five mutations could all occur in nature, but it’d be unlikely in the same copy of the virus. I have no doubt that the media overstated the danger, but it’s still worth thinking about. We now have the tools to create viruses in labs. What happens when someone creates a virus that spreads extremely easily, has greater than 50% mortality, and has an incubation period of several weeks? Something like this, released by a bad guy and without the world having time to prepare, could wipe out more than half the population in a matter of months.  Misguided biotech could effectively end the world as we know it. When the H5N1 work happened, there was a lot of debate about whether or not to release the research. The researchers put a voluntary moratorium on releasing the information, which they lifted earlier this year. Trying to keep things secret is not the answer. Trying to criminalize knowledge of dangerous things (we tried this with the atomic bomb) is definitely not the answer. But ignoring real danger is not the answer either. The world is very bad at coordinated action. Unlike an atomic bomb, which has grave local consequences, the first of these pathogens that gets released could have grave global consequences almost instantly, and give us very little time to react.  While enriching uranium requires the resources of nations, biotech development is already routinely privately funded.Spending a lot of effort on proactive defense against bioattacks is something we should prioritize very highly.  When we first became able to create software programs in garages, it changed the world in very fundamental (mostly positive!) ways. As we begin to be able to create biology programs in garages, we should remember that bigger changes are likely coming--hacking our bodies will likely be more powerful than hacking bits.  We may have to move even faster to adapt our society than we did with the computer revolution. Thanks to Patrick Collison, Connie Gibstine, and Nick Sivo for reading drafts of this. [1] Biotechnology is scary in a lot of non-obvious ways. Sure, it’s easy to understand why superviruses are scary. But another possibility is that we engineer the perfect happiness drug, with no bad side effects, and no one wants to do anything but lay in bed and take this drug all day, sapping all ambition from the human race. There are a lot of other possibilities too, and it’s very hard to think of them because we don’t have much experience with what's about to happen."

        "正文": "When it comes to everything that's not building a great product and getting users, most founders think fundraising is going to be their biggest challenge.  And it is, until they raise money, and then it's hiring.  Hiring is so hard that founders think nothing else will be harder.But then comes a bigger challenge--employee retention.  A reasonably common failure mode for startups is to do a great job recruiting the first ten or so employees and then have many of them leave after 18 months.  Companies build value over very long periods of time, and it's important to have an organizational memory in place while it happens.  Losing the key early employees can be unrecoverable.If you hire great people, retention is very hard--especially because of how easy it has become to start a company.  You're going to lose some people, but if you lose too many, you'll fail.  So it makes sense to spend a lot of time figuring out how to keep talent around.There are three good ways I know of to retain talent (besides generous equity grants, which I'll discuss later). The first is a sense of mission--if employees work at your company because they believe in the importance of the mission, they are unlikely to be tempted by more money elsewhere, and they are likely to be willing to delay starting their own company.  A \"mission\" doesn't have to be saving the world--it can also be solving a very hard technical problem (i.e. interesting work).  But very often, the hard technical problems are important to the world (e.g. Google, Palantir, Facebook).You have to really believe in the mission--if you can't convince yourself that your mission is important, think very hard about what you're doing.  And you have to keep repeating it. [0]I'd go so far as to say that a company that is not mission-oriented will have a hard time being really successful because of talent retention problem.The second good retention strategy is rocketship growth.  Growth is really fun, it means everyone is constantly exposed to new challenges (even if you're not growing fast, find a way to give everyone new challenges all the time), and it holds the promise of life-changing money through equity (salary can never be high enough for this).The third is a great work environment.  This consists of two things--cultural values and team.  Cultural values are difficult to figure out, but worth the effort--it's easy to get lost as you grow, and if you set the values that the company hires for early, you can keep the culture you want for a long time.  On the team side, the cliche of A players wanting to work with other A players is true, and it's an important  reason to never compromise on the first ten hires.  Most great people will not stay at a company long if they're not working with other great people.The best companies combine all three of these strategies, and they are able to retain talent.A common mistake that founders make to try retain employees is to compete in the perks arms race.  This doesn't work--it can temporarily cover up the fact that people don't actually like what they're doing, but not for long, and some other startup will always come up with crazier perks than you anyway.  Of course, it's good to do things that save time and encourage team cohesion--e.g., stuff like meals.Another common mistake founders make (and one I was guilty of!) is not realizing how awful they are to work for--if you're doing all three things above and people are still leaving in droves, think very carefully about what it's like to work for you.Compensation is really important too.  The right thing to do is to be very generous with equity for early employees.  For whatever reason, equity grants are currently swinging the opposite way, especially with bad companies.  Founders and investors both keep making option pools smaller and smaller as a way to solve for founders' desires to have ever-rising valuations; unfortunately for them, it's the valuation at exit and not at funding that counts, and they're doing themselves a real disservice.  Startups are a pass-fail course, and founders are celebrating that they've saved a few percent dilution on their way to failing.What some founders try to do instead of being generous with equity is be extra-generous with salary--say, $250k a year for an engineer right out of college.  This is bad, and although I've seen it attempted a handful of times, I've never seen it work.  It attracts mercenaries who are only there for the money, and who rarely last more than a year.  They generally don't believe in the company or the mission, and they poison the culture.  A flat, reasonable salary for everyone seems to work much better.The bay area has its own special challenges when it comes to retention.  Many people stay at companies for only a year or two, and there is at least some coolness associated with jumping around a lot (to say nothing of the social pressure towards starting your own company).  It's hard to find people that want to really dig in for many years--there is a lot of short-term focus and a massive amount of poaching between companies.  And the cost of living is crazy--the higher salaries that people require create all sorts of issues for companies and leads to lower employee retention.  In fact, if something causes the bay area monopoly on startups to weaken in the near term, I expect it to be around retention challenges or costs. [1] The positive side to all of this is that most startups do such a bad job at retention that if you can do it well, you'll have a huge competitive advantage. Thanks to Patrick Collison for reading a draft of this.[0] PR is as important for retention as recruiting--you should try to repeat your mission as often as you can so that your employees keep hearing it and their friends keep talking about it.[1] As valuations and investment sizes keep going up, the only people I can think of that are clearly better off are bay area real estate owners.  Most of it seems to go to ever-escalating office rents or to higher salaries to pay higher apartment rents."

        "正文": "All companies that grow really big do so in only one way: people recommend the product or service to other people.What this means is that if you want to be a great company some day, you have to eventually build something so good that people will recommend it to their friends--in fact, so good that they want to be the first one to recommend it to their friends for the implied good taste.  No growth hack, brilliant marketing idea, or sales team can save you long term if you don't have a sufficiently good product.You can trick yourself for awhile, though: growth is measured on a percentage basis from last month.  When you are still small, you can spend a lot of money marketing or advertising and have a big impact on usage growth.  But eventually, you get so big you simply can't spend enough money to move the needle--you need your ever-increasing userbase to keep getting you more users.  There are exceptions to this, of course, where monopolies are involved--Microsoft may turn out to be the interesting test case of the extreme outer limit of how long you can manufacture growth.The only way to generate sustained exponential growth is to make whatever you're making sufficiently good.  For example, refer-a-friend-to-earn-credits programs work if the product is good enough to recommend anyway (e.g. Dropbox, Uber).  But they fail for most other startups that try them, because the product isn't good enough yet.Having a growth team is still a good idea--you almost always need to jumpstart things.  But don't forget about what you actually have to accomplish.Thanks to Jack Altman for reading a draft of this."

        "正文": "Maybe bitcoin will be the world reserve currency, maybe it will totally fail, or maybe it will survive in some niche capacity. I don’t know how to weight the probabilities (although I think in the immediate term it's likely to go down), but I do have a thought about the metric to watch: growth in legitimate transactions. A currency without the major use case being legitimate transactions is going to fail.Right now, the dominant use case of bitcoin seems to be speculation, with a secondary use case for illegal transactions. Legal transaction volume is still tiny, and many of those involve the seller immediately converting bitcoins to dollars, with the buyer not desiring to use bitcoin as a new currency but instead a version of either money laundering or tax avoidance. (For example, I have bitcoins that have appreciated a lot. If I sell them, I owe taxes on the gain. If I just buy a bunch of stuff, maybe I don’t, or more precisely, maybe it’s harder to prove. Or maybe it’s just hard to cash out my bitcoins to dollars because the wait times at all the exchanges are really long, and I want to buy stuff anyway.) The fact that the few merchants willing to accept bitcoin generally convert to dollars right away suggests an underlying lack of faith in bitcoin—or at least a problem with the volatility. It’s also a reflection of the reality that a business still needs to deal in dollars with most of the world.  The estimates I’ve heard from smart people that really follow bitcoin are that legitimate transactions are up only about 2-3x from a year ago—wildly outpaced by growth in speculation. If bitcoin is going to work as a currency, at some point before the music stops, legitimate transaction growth needs to really pick up. When friends ask me how to buy bitcoin, I always ask why they want to buy before I help. The main driver is the very human desire to get rich quickly without doing much work combined with a fervent belief that someone else will pay more for the coins later—the tulip strategy. The second major reason is out of fear that there is a small chance bitcoin becomes the reserve currency. Even if the chance is tiny, maybe it makes sense to buy some as a hedge (this was why I bought the small amount that I have). Neither of these can sustain bitcoin as a currency, nor can drugs and gambling (people that make their money in the underworld still need money that can buy regular things, and so whatever is used to track exchange still needs to be pegged to dollars or whatever). The tulip strategy is especially scary; an eventual crash could be so severe that it will shake even the truest believer’s conviction. The price of tulip bulbs has yet to recover from its 1637 peak. Some people claim that bitcoin is not really a currency but a store of value, like gold.  Maybe.  This would be a personal blindspot for me; I’ve never thought gold was the best place to put money. As I understand it, some people transact in gold, and it has at least some industrial and ornamental uses. It seems to me that the people that prepare for the end of the world—i.e. the people I know that really like gold—are likely to prefer something they can hold in their hands than something that requires the Internet to keep working. Whether or not bitcoin should be compared to dollars or gold, there are a lot other weird factors at play that make it hard to weight probabilities—for example, bitcoin provides a way to convert RMB into dollars. You can mine bitcoin with energy purchased in RMB and then later sell those reward bitcoins for dollars!  This is just one of many ways to use it for money laundering--there are lots more, and this alone may be enough to sustain it for awhile. A second big issue until the US switches from USD to BTC, you’re still going to owe taxes in dollars. The fact that you have to do things like pay taxes and buy oil in dollars seems to make it hard for bitcoin to become the reserve currency—people will still need dollars more than they need bitcoins.(Patrick Collison says: \"I personally think this is overestimated. Tax is a big deal, of course, but even nations can't always compete with the popular sentiment tidal forces enabled by the internet.\")\nA third issue is that although we have big strong guys holding guns to remind anyone that a dollar is worth a dollar, we do not have such an effective reminder that a bitcoin is worth a bitcoin.  Currencies have traditionally needed a central actor to enforce them. All of that said, there’s clearly something very interesting going on. And the bull case is exciting—a world where we all transact in bitcoin would be much more transparent, and financial transparency is great. It’s perhaps the thing that would most reduce corruption.  (Of course, it's possible, even likely, that everyone just gets good at anonymizing bitcoin by passing around entire wallets or whatever.)  Transparency is not the only benefit--for example, even if we don't get transparency, low transaction costs for worldwide commerce would still be great. Just as it’d be stupid to convert all your dollars to bitcoin, it’d be stupid to not pay attention.  Specifically, watch legitimate transaction volume--I'd suggest only buying if it shows signs of seriously ramping up.Thanks to Patrick Collison and Lachy Groom for reading drafts of this."

        "正文": "Maybe now we’re actually in the early stages of a startup\nbubble.  Valuations are trending up\nagain.  And no one is talking about a\nbubble anymore, so it could be happening. \n\nMany companies still feel reasonably priced.  Yes, Facebook is up 70% in the last six\nmonths, but I think it’s likely still undervalued.  Lots of companies raising B rounds are doing\nit with large profits and at reasonable multiples.\n\nBut the very early stage feels somewhat out of whack.  Companies raising money at $15MM+ plus valuations\nwith no traction and no real vision beyond starting a startup still strikes me\nas unsustainable (not to mention bad for the companies).\n\nLots of other signs point to a bubble—founders of Series A\nstage companies being angel investors, a significant uptick in the number of\nparties, soaring rents, soaring salaries,\nlots of new investors coming to valley, and MBAs starting companies as the fashionable\nthing to do again.\n\nEven if this is the beginning of a bubble, it will likely go\non for awhile longer—at least as long as the Fed keeps the stimulus going, and likely\nlonger.  Maybe it goes on for another\ncouple of years.\n\nWe can debate whether or not companies are overpriced, but\nit is an absolute certainty that at the first sign of real trouble, most\ninvestors will overreact and invest much less precisely at the time they should\nbe investing more.\n\nSo the question is, if you believe that this may be the\nbeginning of a bubble, what should you do now?\n\nFortunately, the answers are things you should be doing\nanyway.\n\nFirst, you should not be too afraid.  The only thing that is cheap during a startup\nbubble is capital.  Everything else is\nrelatively more expensive.  If you’re a\nreal company, a downturn that you’re prepared for can be beneficial.  Good companies can make incredible strides\nduring a bust.\n\nMake sure you have enough money in the bank, and treat this\nmoney as the last money you’ll ever raise—at the very least, have a plan B to\nget to profitability without raising any additional capital.  If you need to raise more, this is a good\ntime to do it.\n\nFocus on a path to profitability.  Remember that, if your customers are mostly\nstartups, revenue can dry up fast.\n\nResist the urge to ramp up to a crazy burn rate.  Be especially fearful of long-term\ncommitments like expensive leases and people. \nDon’t hire unnecessary people. \nStay as lean as you can.  Establish\na culture of frugality.\n\nBubbles bursting also require startups to focus, which is a\ngood thing to be doing in any case.  Cut\nproducts and features that are not working. \nFocus relentlessly.\n\nOf course, people are terrible at predicting bubbles and\nbusts, so I’m likely wrong.  Luckily, I\nreally do believe these are good things to do anyway."

        "正文": "After startups raise money, their next biggest problem becomes\nhiring.  It turns out it’s both really\nhard and really important to hire good people; in fact, it’s probably the most\nimportant thing a founder does.\n\nIf you don’t hire very well, you will not be successful—companies are\na product of the team the founders build. \nThere is no way you can build an important company by yourself.  It’s easy to delude yourself into thinking\nthat you can manage a mediocre hire into doing good work.\n\nHere is some advice about hiring:\n\n*Spend more time on it.\n\nThe vast majority of founders don’t spend nearly enough time\nhiring.  After you figure out your vision\nand get product-market fit, you should probably be spending between a third and\na half of your time hiring.  It sounds\ncrazy, and there will always be a ton of other work, but it’s the\nhighest-leverage thing you can do, and great companies always, always have\ngreat people.\n\nYou can’t outsource this—you need to be spending time identifying\npeople, getting potential candidates to want to work at your company, and\nmeeting every person that comes to interview. \nKeith Rabois believes the CEO/founders should interview every candidate\nuntil the company is at least 500 employees.\n\n*In the beginning, get your hands dirty.\n\nSpeaking of spending time, you should spend the time to learn a role\nbefore you hire for it.  If you don’t\nunderstand it, it’s very hard to get the right person.  The classic example of this is a hacker-CEO\ndeciding to hire a VP of Sales because he doesn’t want to get his hands dirty.  This does not work.  He needs to do it himself first and learn it\nin detail.  Then after that, he should\nlean on his board or investors to give him opinions on his final few\ncandidates. \n\n*Look for smart, effective people.\n\nThere are always specifics of what you need in a particular role, but\nsmart and effective have got to be table stakes.  It’s amazing how often people are willing to\nforgo these requirements; predictably, those hires don’t work out in the early\ndays of a startup (they may never work).\n\nFortunately, these are easy to look for.\n\nTalk to the candidates about what they’ve done.  Ask them about their most impressive projects\nand biggest wins.  Specifically, ask them\nabout how they spend their time during an average day, and what they got done\nin the last month.  Go deep in a specific\narea and ask about what the candidate actually did—it’s easy to take credit for\na successful project.  Ask them how they\nwould solve a problem you are having related to the role they are interviewing\nfor.\n\nThat, combined with the right questions when you check references,\nwill usually give you a good feel about effectiveness.  And usually you can gauge intelligence by the\nend of an hour-long conversation.  If you\ndon’t learn anything in the interview, that’s bad.  If you are bored in the interview, that’s\nreally bad.  A good interview should feel\nlike a conversation, not questions and responses. \n\nRemember that in a startup, anyone you hire is likely to be doing a\nnew job in three to six months.  Smart\nand effective people are adaptable.\n\n*Have people audition for roles instead of interviewing for them.\n\nThis is the most important tactical piece of advice I have.  It is difficult to know what it’s like\nworking with someone after a few interviews; it is quite easy to know what it’s\nlike after working with them \n\nWhenever possible (and it’s almost always possible), have someone do a\nday or two of work with you before you hire her; you can do this at night or on\nthe weekends.  If you’re interviewing a\ndeveloper, have her write code for a real but non-critical project.  For a PR person, have her write a press\nrelease and identify reporters to pitch it to. \nJust have the person sign a contractor agreement and pay them for this\nwork like a normal contractor.\n\nYou’ll get a much, much better sense of what it’s like working with\nthis person and how good she is at the role than you can ever get in just an\ninterview.  And she’ll get a feel for\nwhat working at your company is like.\n\n*Focus on the right ways to source candidates.\n\nBasically, this boils down to “use your personal networks more”.  By at least a 10x margin, the best candidate\nsources I’ve ever seen are friends and friends of friends.  Even if you don’t think you can get these\npeople, go after the best ones relentlessly. \nIf it works out 5% of the time, it’s still well worth it. \n\nAll the best startups I know manage to hire like this for much longer\nthan one would think possible.  Most bad\nstartups make excuses for not doing this.\n\nWhen you hire someone, as soon as you’re sure she’s a star you should\nsit her down and wring out of her the names of everyone that you should try to\nhire.  You may have to work pretty hard\nat this.\n\nOften, to get great people, you have to poach.  They’re never looking for jobs, so don’t\nlimit your recruiting to people that are looking for jobs.  A difficult question is what you should do\nabout poaching from acquaintances—I don’t have a great answer for this.  A friend says, “Poaching is the titty twister\nof Silicon Valley relationships”. \n\nTechnical recruiters are pretty bad. \nThe job boards are generally worse. \nConferences can be good.  Hosting\ninteresting tech talks can be good for technical hiring.  University recruiting works well once you’re\nreasonably established.\n\nDon’t limit your search to candidates in your area.  This is especially true if you’re in the bay\narea; lots of people want to move here.\n\nView candidate sourcing as a long-term investment—you may spend time\nnow with someone that you don’t even talk to about a job for a year or more.\n\nUse you investors and their networks to find candidates.  In your investor update emails, let them know\nwhat kind of people you need to hire.\n\nAs a side note, if I were going to jump into the mosh pit of people\nstarting recruiting startups, I would try to make it look as much like personal\nnetwork hiring as possible, since that’s what seems to work.  I’d love a service that would let me see how\neveryone in my company was connected to a candidate, and be able to search\npersonal networks of people in the company (LinkedIn is probably good at this\nfor hiring sales people but not very good at this for developers). \n\n*Have a mission, and don’t be surprised at how much selling you’ll\nhave to do.\n\nYou need a mission in order to hire well.  In addition to wanting to work with a great\nteam, candidates need to believe in your mission—i.e., why is this job more\nimportant than any of the others they could take?  Having a mission that gets people excited is\nprobably the best thing you can do to get a great team on board before you have\nrunaway traction. \n\nAs a founder, you’ll assume that everyone will be as excited about\nyour company as you are.  In reality, no\none will.  You need to spend a lot of\ntime getting candidates excited about your mission. \n\nIf you have a good mission and you’re good at selling it, you’ll be\nable to get slightly overqualified people—although, in a fast-growing startup,\nthey’ll end up in a role that they feel not quite ready for quickly anyway.\n\nYou should use your board and your investors to help you close\ncandidates.\n\nOnce you decide you want someone, switch into closing mode.  The person that the new hire will report to\n(and ideally also the CEO) should be doing everything possible to close the\ncandidate, and talking to her about once a day.\n\n*Hire people you like.\n\nAt Stripe, I believe they call this the Sunday test—would you be\nlikely to come into the office on a Sunday because you want to hang out with\nthis person?  Liking the people you work\nwith is pretty important to the right kind of company culture.  Only a few times have I ever seen a scenario\nwhere I didn’t like an otherwise very good candidate.  I only made the hire once, and it was a\nmistake.\n\nThat being said, remember you want at least some diversity of\nthought.  There are some attributes where\nyou want uniformity—integrity, intelligence, etc.—and there are some where you\nwant coverage of the entire range.\n\n*Have a set of cultural values you hire for.\n\nSpend a lot of time figuring out what you want your cultural values to\nbe (there are some good examples on the Internet).  Make sure the whole company knows what they\nare and buys into them.  Anyone you hire\nshould be a cultural fit.\n\nAndrew Mason says “Values are a decision making framework that empower\nindividuals to make the decision that you, the founder, would make, in\nsituations where there are conflicting interests (e.g. growth vs. customer\nsatisfaction)”.\n\nTreat your values as articles of faith.  Screen candidates for these values and be\nwilling to let an otherwise good candidate go if he is not a cultural fit.  Diversity of opinions and certain\ncharacteristics (e.g. you want nerds and athletes both on the team) is good;\ndiversity of values in a startup is bad.\n\nThere are some people that are so set in their ways they will never\nget behind your values; you will probably end up firing them.\n\nAs a side note, avoid remote employees in the early days.  As a culture is still gelling, it’s important\nto have everyone in the same building.\n\n*Don’t compromise.\n\nIn the grind of a startup, you’ll always need someone yesterday and\nit’s easy to hire someone that is not quite smart enough or a good enough\nculture fit because you really need a specific job done.  Especially in the early days, never\ncompromise.  A single bad hire left\nunfixed for long can kill a company. \nIt’s better to lose a deal or be late on a product or whatever than to\nhire someone mediocre.\n\nGreat people attract other great people; as soon as you get a mediocre\nperson in the building, this entire phenomenon can unwind.\n\n*Be generous with compensation packages, but mostly with equity.\n\nYou should be very frugal with nearly everything in a startup.  Compensation for great people is an\nexception.\n\nWhere you want to be generous, though, is with equity.  Ideally, you end up paying people slightly\nbelow to roughly market salaries but with a very generous equity package.  “Experienced” people often have higher\npersonal burn rates and sometimes you’ll need to pay them more, but remember\nthat great companies are not usually created by experienced people (with the\nexception of a few roles where it really matters a lot.)\n\nI am sure I will get flamed for saying this, but it’s the right\nstrategy—if you want an above-market salary, go work at a big company with no\nequity upside.\n\nIdeally, you want to pay people just enough they don’t stress about\ncash flow.  Equity is harder, but a good\nrule for the first 20 hires seems to be about double what your investors\nsuggest.  For a company on a good but not\nabsolute breakout trajectory, some rough numbers I’ve seen are about 1.5% for\nthe first engineer and about 0.25% for the twentieth.  But the variance is huge.\n\nIncidentally, a very successful\nYC company has a flat salary for effectively all of their engineers, and it\nseems to work well.  It's lower than what these people could get\nelsewhere, but clearly they enjoy the work and believe the stock is going to be\nworth a lot.  The sorts of people that\nwill take this deal are the kind of people you want in a startup.  And unless something goes really wrong, at\nthis point, these engineers are going to make way more money than that would\nhave taking higher salaries elsewhere—not to mention how much better their work\nenvironment has been. \n\nYou will likely have to negotiate a\nlittle bit.  Learn how to do this.  In general, materially breaking your\ncompensation structure to get someone is a bad idea—word gets out and everyone\nwill be upset.\n\n*Watch out for red flags and trust your gut.\n\nThere are a few things in the interviewing/negotiating process that\nyou should watch out for because they usually mean that person will not be\nsuccessful in a startup.  A focus on\ntitle is an example; a focus on things like “how many reports will be in my\norganization” is an even worse example. \nYou’ll develop a feel for these sorts of issues very quickly; don’t\nbrush them off.\n\nIf you have a difficult-to-articulate desire to pass, pass.\n\n*Always be recruiting. \n\nUnfortunately, recruiting usually doesn’t work as a transactional\nactivity.  You have to view it as\nsomething you always do, not something you start when you need to fill a role immediately.  There’s a fair amount of unpredictability in\nthe process; if you find someone great for a role you won’t need for two\nmonths, you should still hire her now. \n\n*Fire fast.\n\nI have never met a newbie founder that fires fast enough; I have also\nnever met a founder who doesn’t learn this lesson after a few years. \n\nYou will not get 100% of your hires right.  When it’s obviously not working, it’s\nunlikely to start working.  It’s better\nfor everyone involved to part ways quickly, instead of hanging on to\nunrealistic dreams that it’s going to get better.  This is especially true for the person you\nhave to let go—if they’re just at your company for a couple of months, it’s a\nnon-issue in future interviews.  And\neveryone else at the company is probably aware that the person is not working\nout before you are.\n\nHaving to fire people is one of the worst things a founder has to do,\nbut you have to just get it over with and trust that it will work out better\nthan dragging things out.\n\n*Put a little bit of rigor around the hiring process.\n\nMake everyone on your team commit to a hire/no hire decision for\neveryone they meet, and write up their thoughts.  If you get it wrong, this is useful to look\nback at later.  It’s good to have a brief\nin-person discussion with the entire interviewing team after a candidate\nleaves.\n\nHave someone take the candidate out to lunch or dinner.  Insist that everyone is on time and prepared\nfor interviews/auditions.  Make sure\nevery candidate leaves with a positive impression of your company.\n\nBe organized—one person should coordinate the entire interview\nprocess, make sure every topic you want to cover gets covered, convene people\nfor the discussion after all interviews are done, etc.  Also, have a consistent framework for how you\ndecide whether or not to hire—do you need unanimous consent?\n\nRemember that despite being great at what they do your team may not be\ngreat interviewers.  It’s important to\nteach people how to interview.\n\n*Don’t hire. \n\nMany founders hire just because it seems like a cool thing to do, and\npeople always ask how many employees you have. \nCompanies generally work better when they are smaller.  It’s always worth spending time to think\nabout the least amount of projects/work you can feasibly do, and then having as\nsmall a team as possible to do it. \n\nDon’t hire for the sake of hiring. \nHire because there is no other way to do what you want to do.\n\n \n\n \n\nGood luck.  Hiring is very hard\nbut very important work.  And don’t\nforget that after you hire people, you need to keep them.  Remember to check in with people, be a good\nmanager, have regular all hands meetings, make sure people are happy and\nchallenged, etc.  Always keep a sense of\nmomentum at your company—that’s important to retaining talent.  Give people new roles every six months or so.  And of course, continue to focus on bringing\ntalented people into the company—that alone will make other good people want to\nstay.\n\nAlways be identifying and promoting new talent.  This is not as sexy as thinking about new\nproblems to solve, but it will make you successful. \n\nThanks to Patrick Collison, Andrew Mason, Keith Rabois, Geoff Ralston,\nand Nick Sivo for reading drafts of this."

        "正文": "A friend recently asked me for my list of current breakout\ncompanies.  I made it, and noticed that\nall of them had only one thing in common. \nI then went back through the last three YC batches and looked at our\ntop-ranked companies (although we get it wrong plenty of times, it’s reasonably\npredictive).  These companies had the\nsame trait. \n\nThis shared trait is a connection between the online and the\nphysical worlds.  There are two main\nmodels for this—the Uber model, where you push a button on a website/app and\nsomething happens in the real world, and the Airbnb model, where you use a\nservice to do something in the real world that would be possible but extremely\ninefficient.  In both cases, the key\nthing is enabling users to do things they do in real life much more easily—yes,\nyou could have called a cab company, but it took a long time, the cab didn’t\nalways come, you didn’t know when it was near, you had to have cash or get a\nnasty look from the cabbie, etc.\n\nEven Facebook is a lightweight version of this—with\nFacebook, you bring your real world online so you can interface with it more\noften, more easily, and from anywhere. \nFacebook has obviously been much more successful than services like\nSecondLife, which were entirely virtual, and services MySpace, which were less\nabout real identity and real friends. \nAmazon was perhaps the original example of bridging these two worlds.\n\nAs a corollary, new companies that exist only in the real or\nonline world do not seem to do as well as companies that connect them.  This happens more often on the online side\nthan the physical side, both because we generally don’t think of things like\nbarbershops as startups and because most people don’t expect pure hardware\ncompanies without a strong Internet component to do very well.  And this bridge is often a matter of\ndegree—many, if not most, online companies touch the real world in some\nway.  But the ones that do it the most\nseem to be doing better.\n\nIn many ways, this is a version of Marc Andreessen’s “software\nis eating the world”.  To eat the world,\nyou have to operate in the world.  I\nthink two big reasons it’s happening so much now are 1) smartphones are in\neveryone’s hands and 2) there is a level of personal comfort with putting real\nlife on the internet that seems to have tipped about two years ago.\n\nThere are probably a lot of areas where this doesn’t\napply—enterprise software and developer tools, for instance—and there are clear\ncounterexamples like Google.  But as a general rule, it seems to be worth considering when\nthinking about new businesses.   "

        "正文": "“I’m an ambitious 19 year old, what should I do?” \n\nI get asked this question fairly often, and I now have a lot\nof data on what works, so I thought I’d share my response.\n\nUsually, people are deciding between going to college (and\nusually working on side projects while they do so), joining a company, or\nstarting their own startup. [1] [2]\n\nThe secret is that any of these can be right answer, and you\nshould make your decision based on the specific circumstances of each\noption.  The critical point is that you\nwant to do the thing that is most likely to get you on a path to do something\ngreat.\n\nNo matter what you choose, build stuff and be around smart\npeople.  “Stuff” can be a lot of\ndifferent things—open source projects outside of class, a startup, a new sales\nprocess at a company you work at—but, obviously, sitting around talking with\nyour friends about how you guys really should build a website together does not\ncount.\n\nThe best people always seem to be building stuff and hanging\naround smart people, so if you have to decide between several options, this may\nbe a good filter.\n\nWorking on something good will pull you along a path where\ngood things keep happening to you.  (In\nfact, this effect is so strong that there’s a danger of getting sucked into too\nmany interesting things and getting distracted from what you really want to\ndo.)\n\nIn making this decision, you want to take the right kind of\nrisk.  Most people think about risk the\nwrong way—for example, staying in college seems like a non-risky path.  However, getting nothing done for four of\nyour most productive years is actually pretty risky.  Starting a company that you’re in love with\nis the right kind of risk.  Becoming\nemployee number 50 at a company that still has a good chance of failure is the\nwrong kind of risk.\n\nIf you stay in college, make sure you learn something\nworthwhile and work on interesting projects—college is probably the best place\nto meet people to work with.  If you’re\nreally worried you’ll miss some critical social experience by dropping out of\ncollege, you should probably stay.\n\nIf you join a company, my general advice is to join a\ncompany on a breakout trajectory.  There\nare a usually a handful of these at a time, and they are usually identifiable\nto a smart young person.  They are a very\ngood risk/reward tradeoff.  Such a\ncompany is almost certainly going to be successful, but the rest of the world\nisn’t quite as convinced of it as they should be.  Fortunately, these companies love ambitious\nyoung people.  In addition to the equity\nbeing a great deal (you might get 1/10th of the equity you’d get if\nyou join a tiny new startup, but at 1/100th or 1/1000th\nof the risk), you will work with very good people, learn what success looks\nlike, and get a W on your record (which turns out to be quite valuable).  Spending a few years at a company that fails\nhas path consequences, and working at an already-massively-successful company\nmeans you will learn much less, and probably work with less impressive people.\n\nIncidentally, don’t let salary be a factor.  I just watched someone turn down one\nof these breakout companies because Microsoft offered him $30k per year more in\nsalary—that was a terrible decision.  He\nwill not build interesting things and may not work with smart people.  In a few years, when it’s time for something\nnew, the options in front of him will be much worse than they could have been.\n\nIf you start a company, only do so if you have an idea\nyou’re in love with.  If you’re hanging\nout with your friends trying to come up with an idea, I don’t think you should\nstart that company (although there are many who disagree with me).  Starting a failed startup is less bad than\njoining a failed company as an employee (and you’ll certainly learn much more\nin the former case).  If you fail at an\nidea that you really loved and could have been great, you’re unlikely to regret\nit, and people will not hold it against you. Failing at a me-too copycat\nstartup is worse.  Remember that there\nwill be lots of other opportunities to start companies, and that startups are a\n6-10 year commitment—wait for the right one\n\nOne big pro for starting a company is that it’s usually the\nway to learn the most in the shortest amount of time.  One big con is that it’s easy to start a\ncompany for the wrong reasons—usually so that you can say you’re starting a\ncompany—and this makes it easy to cloud your judgment. \n\nNo matter what you choose, keep your personal burn rate low\nand minimize your commitments.  I have\nseen a lot of people miss great opportunities because they couldn’t afford a\nreduction in salary or because they couldn’t move or didn’t have the time.\n\nThink about risk the right way.  Drew Houston gave a great commencement speech\nwhere he said you only have to be right once. \nThat’s true.  The risk is not\ngetting on the path where you get to be right that one critical time.  \n\n \n\nThanks to Lachy Groom and Nick Sivo for reading drafts of\nthis. \n\n[1] Sometimes, a 4th option is being a VC.  This is usually a mistake—the best way to become\na VC is not to grind your way up the ladder from junior associate intern.  Even if you want to be a VC, you’re much\nbetter off starting or joining a startup, and getting partner offers when\nyou’re 28.  Plus, good founders want to\nwork with an investor that has operational experience.\n\n[2] Interestingly, no one is ever considering going into\nacademia."

        "正文": "There’s a lot of debate about whether or not the pace\nof innovation has slowed, and if so, what that means.  After some particularly brutal pitches that\nfelt like Saturday Night Live parodies of startups, I feel compelled to weigh\nin.  This question cannot be answered with a yes or a no; innovation has\nslowed dramatically in some areas and gone faster than most people would have\nthought possible in others.  It’s interesting to ponder why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were once great at innovating in the physical\nworld.  Sometimes I stand in Manhattan\nand think about how amazing it is that everything around me was dug out of the\nground, and made with things that were dug out of the ground.  Making an\niPhone starts with digging silicon out of the ground, putting some impurities\nin it and making it into a chip. Then robots, also made with metal mined from\nthe ground, assemble all the chips plus more stuff dug out from the ground to\nmake a phone.\n\nBut recently, software (and mostly Internet software) has\nbeen the focus of innovation, and its importance is probably still underestimated—there\nare compounding effects to how it’s changing the world that we’re only now\nbeginning to see.\n\nIt’s amazing how fast it’s happened.\n\nIn 1990, the Internet was 21 years old and only 2.8\nmillion people had access to it. \n(HTML/HTTP wouldn’t be released for another year.)   There are\nnow over 2.5 billion Internet users—a nearly 100,000% increase in 23\nyears.  Also in 1990, there were 12.4 million mobile phone\nsubscribers.  These were very basic phones, of course—even in 1999, there\nwas no such thing as smartphone.  In 2012, the number of global smartphone\nusers crossed 1 billion, and the number of mobile phone subscribers is much\ngreater.  There are now approximately as many mobile subscriptions (not\nunique subscribers) as people in the world!\n\nBut innovation in the physical world (besides phones\nand computers) over the same time period has been less impressive.  We\nwent from the first flight with a piston engine to the first flight with a jet\nengine in about 30 years; 30 years after that we landed on the moon. \nSince 1939, jet engines have certainly improved incrementally, but I’m still\nwaiting to travel by ramjet (which incidentally was patented in 1908). \nWhen we made it to the moon in 1969—guided by computers with 64KB of memory and\na clock speed of 0.043MHz, similar to a modern high-end toothbrush—people\nthought the rest of the solar system and the stars were not far off.  We\nare still waiting.        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nIn the 1960s, oil was our primary energy source, followed\nby coal, gas, hydro, nuclear, and a tiny fraction of renewables.  Today,\nthe order is…oil, coal, gas, hydro, nuclear, and a tiny fraction of renewables.        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nInstead of way better ways to generate energy, we talk\nabout reducing usage.  I’m all for conservation, but there’s still\nsomething defeatist about it—weren’t we supposed to be generating huge amounts\nof cheap, clean energy by now? \n\nThere are countless other examples of apparent lack of\nbreakthrough progress in materials science, biotech, food, healthcare,\netc.  I can’t order food from a Replicator.  In some ways we’ve even backtracked—I\nhave not been able to travel faster than the speed of sound since I was a\nkid.   (To be fair, there may be\ngreat innovation happening now that is difficult to see.  Innovation often looks like the creation of\nidle toys while it’s happening, and only in retrospect can we see how important\ndevelopments really are.)\n\nThere’s another important consideration in addition to\nsoftware/physical—short-term/long-term (or incremental/radically new). \nWe’ve seen much more progress on things that can be incrementally improved in a\nshort time frame than things that require open-ended, new development. \nThis is true for both software and physical things.  For example, there\nare a huge number of people working on making websites really nice-looking and\neasy-to-use—and they’re doing a fine job—but not very many people working on\nartificial intelligence.  There are a decent number of people working on\nmore efficient jet engines, but not very many civilians working on replacing the\njet engine with something new.\n\nIncremental progress is good—it compounds, and it’s a\nway to develop great things eventually.  It works a much higher percentage\nof the time than step change innovation.  It’s certainly the model I’ve\nobserved help many startups reach great success.  The iPhone, which I\nthink is the most important innovation of 2005-2010, came about at least\nsomewhat via compounding incremental progress.  But there were a few\ncritical discontinuities, and Apple took as much time as they needed to figure\nthose out.  They also had the luxury of one guy saying that they were\ngoing to do these crazy things like ship a phone with no keyboard running a\nreal OS and require everyone to buy a data plan. \n\nPart of the reason Internet businesses have been so\nsuccessful is that it’s easy to iterate quickly with incremental changes. \nThis makes them appealing businesses.  But there are some things\nincremental refinement will never get us.\n\nOn the software side, it’s relatively easy right now\nto raise money for a new website or mobile app that brings an existing, offline\nindustry online.  In most cases, this is a real, but small, step forward. \nIt’s harder to raise money for software companies working on uncertain,\nlong-term, high-reward projects (like AI).  When it comes to hardware, it’s\nmedium hard to raise money for a consumer hardware company, even with a\nwell-understood plan and a short timeframe to ship [0].  It’s very difficult to raise money for a new\ncar company, a new rocket company, a new energy company, etc.\n\nRight now in Silicon Valley, most investors are more\ninterested in your growth graph than your long-term plan—i.e., more interested in the past than the future. \nSome possible explanations for this are risk aversion and intellectual\nlaziness.  (Actually, it’s a little\nbetter than that—compounding growth is an extremely powerful force, and if\ninvestors believe growth will keep going at the same rate, then they can be\nmaking a very wise decision.)  This focus\nmakes it hard for companies to raise money if they’re doing things that won’t\nhave a growth graph of any sort for years.\n\nLooking at the past and projecting it forward is good\nfor public market investors, who probably should judge a company on past\nperformance.  But venture investors are\nsupposed to be taking risks on unproven technology and ideas.  Perversely, in the current world, public\nmarket investors love to speculate about the future when pricing a stock\n(sometimes getting themselves badly burned, e.g. the Internet bubble) while\nmost venture investors—the occasional $40+MM A round aside—seem to be leaning\nin Benjamin Graham’s direction [1].\n\nA two-by-two matrix of progress in innovation (and\nease of attracting investment) with software/physical on one axis and\nshort-term/long-term on the other axis looks like this:        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n Green is good, yellow is ok, and red is bad.\n\nI don’t think it’s totally correct to say that innovation\nhas slowed—what’s happened is that innovative energy has mostly been directed\nto short-timeframe opportunities in software.  This is at least mostly\nrational—honestly, over the last few decades there have just been way more\nsuccesses in the computer industry than in biotech, cleantech, etc.  \nThe virtual world is far, far less regulated than the physical world, which\nmakes it a less risky place to start a new business.  (Although a very\ninteresting side note is that many of the most successful Internet businesses\nhave been ones that connect the virtual to the physical world in some way.)   And\nmany founders, if you catch them after a few drinks, will often say that they\nwant to get rich in a small handful of years, and timeframes on the Internet\nare much faster.  Many investors are even worse on this point.\n\nAnd most importantly, computers are awesome. \nAgain, it’s not clear to me that we’re worse off focusing our collective energy\nhere, although I do think we should do more on the long-term\nopportunities.  If the Internet is the most important development of the last\n30 years, it makes sense to have most of our best people working on it [2]. \n\nAnd now we get to the fundamental issue with\ninnovation today.  People—founders, employees, and investors—are looking\nfor low-cost (and virtual is lower cost than physical), short-term\nopportunities.  But what causes the low-cost, short-timeframe preference?\n\nFor one, there is some deeply human appeal to getting\nrich quickly, which has probably been around forever.  Investing in\nsoftware businesses has worked (sometimes), and will probably continue to do so\nfor some time.  Software has been a great\nplace—that did not exist during the physical innovation boom—to direct\ninvestment capital.\n\nWe haven’t had a really capital-intensive war in a\nlong time, and while that’s obviously great, I am always astonished when I read\nabout how much real innovation has involved the military or national\nsecurity—it’s hard to get effectively unlimited budgets and focus any other\nway.  The Internet itself came from the\nmilitary.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty for non-Internet businesses is\nanother issue, which can at least be improved—although it will be challenging\nto ever match the freedom of the Internet. \n\nPerhaps most importantly of all, we can use software\nto drive innovation in the non-software world by doing as much as possible in\nsoftware.  We should focus on the\nintersection of software and everything else—for example, programs that let us\ndo design in software can bring down cost and cycle time.  I believe that short sub-project times are\nalmost always a win, and many companies in the physical realm seem to have long\ntimelines without a lot of intermediate milestones.  \n\nAnother thing we can do is to better reward truly\nlong-term investing.  Right now, there’s a focus on the extreme\nshort-term—many investors care mostly about what earnings are going to be next\nquarter, and the rise in volume of weekly options has been impressive.  Unfortunately,\nwhat Wall Street thinks trickles down the pyramid to venture capitalists and even\nangel investors, so we see a shortening of time horizons everywhere.  This\nis probably difficult to stop entirely, but I’m sure that a very favorable tax\npolicy on multi-year holdings (and an even less favorable one for short-term\nholdings) would help. \n\nVenture funds commonly have a ten year life; lengthening\nthat to fifteen or twenty might help.  I’d\nalso like to see companies move to five- or six-year vesting for founders and\nemployees.  \n\nOr maybe we need a new funding model for radical\ninnovation.  Investment capital will look for the best risk-adjusted\nreturn; right now, lots of investors believe Internet companies are it.  As\nmentioned above, many of the things we consider to be breakthrough innovations\nwith physical things happened before computers, when there was not such a\nreadily available and attractive investment platform.  Investors are often\nmaking rational decisions by choosing a shorter-timeframe opportunity that\nrequires less capital.  So maybe the government needs to spend more money\non discovery (although right now, it’s decreasing funding for things like the\nNational Labs and the NIH), and maybe there’s a philanthropic model that makes\nsense.\n\nAnd there are probably a lot of other things we should\nbe doing too. \n\nI am a proud child of the computer age.  I can’t imagine life without them, and I’m\nhappy lots of people are working to make them better.  Although it makes sense that most innovation\nis happening incrementally on the Internet, it would be a shame for us as a\nspecies to lose the drive for the sort of discontinuous innovations that got us\nthe Internet in the first place.  I can’t\ngo live in a computer yet, so I’d also like the real world to continue to get\nbetter.\n\nThanks to Jack Altman, Patrick Collison, Kevin Lawler,\nEric Migicovsky, Geoff Ralston, and Nick Sivo for reading drafts of this.\n\n [0] ]It used to\nbe really hard, but preorders have made it easier.  For example, Pebble\nwas unable to raise money from investors until they no longer needed it—they\ncollected more than $10MM in effective preorders on Kickstarter.  But\nuntil then, investors dismissed them, saying “we don’t like hardware.”\n\n[1] No disrespect to Color’s investors—they believed\nstrongly in something radical, without a growth graph, and took a big capital\nrisk.  I’d be happy to see more of that,\nbut maybe for different sorts of companies.\n\n[2] Talk about STEM—the study of science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics—is mostly BS.  Learning to hack\nRails in ten weeks is regrettably a good career move as of June 20th,\n2013.  Learning physics over ten years has a much worse economic\npayoff.  In today’s world, we have programming, and we have everything\nelse.  At least in terms of a plan to become qualified for better jobs,\nSTEM should be renamed CS.\n\nAs a side note to the side note, I don’t blame finance\nfor stealing our good engineers.  The\nfailure is that non-CS engineering career paths don’t look very attractive\nright now."

Having at least\none investor very focused on your company is valuable, even if the investor is\nnot very good.  The cadence and rhythm of\nmeeting with someone every month to review progress and goals turns out to be an\nimportant focusing function [1].\n\nIn a typical party round, no single investor cares enough to\nthink about the company multiple times a day. \nEach investor assumes that at least 1 of the N other investors will be\nclosely involved, but in fact no one is, and the companies sometimes wander off\ninto a very unfocused wilderness.\n\nWhile it’s true that many investors are bad, I have found\nwonderful exceptions.  Good investors\nstay out of the way when you don’t need them and help you a lot when you\ndo.  This is really valuable—it turns out\nthat most of the great companies end up having great investors.\n\nAdditionally, a closely involved investor will help\ncoordinate your next round, and can bridge the company if necessary (things\noften take longer than founders plan). \nI’ve noticed that companies that raise party rounds seem to have a\nharder time raising their next round compared to companies that raised their\nfirst big round from a VC.\n\nPerhaps another reason that party round companies have a\nharder time raising capital is that worse companies get funded this\nway—everyone seems less disciplined in deciding to invest.  Social proof plays a large role, and because\nthe amounts are smaller people don’t think as hard about the quality of the\nbusiness.\n\nI’m all for seeing founders have more power and more\nownership, and I’m all for VCs being forced to evolve, but I don’t think that\nhaving party rounds replace what used to be an A round is the answer.\n\n \n\n[1] There is a version of this that makes Y Combinator\nwork—the deadline of Demo Day is extremely good at focusing companies on the\nright things."

spend at least a third of your time on it.\n\n16. \nOccasionally\nthink about why the 20th person will join your company.\n\n17. \nHire smart and\neffective people that are committed to what you’re doing.  The last five words there are important.\n\n18. \nHire friends and friends of friends.  Go after these people like crazy to get them\nto join.  Some other candidate sources\nare ok, but I always got bad results from technical recruiters.\n\n19. \nGenerally,\nvalue aptitude over experience.\n\n20. \nHire people\nthat you could describe as animals.\n\n21. \nEliminate\ndistractions.\n\n22. \nDon’t die.\n\n23. \nBe frugal.\n\n24. \nYou’ll often hear conflicting advice about everything but “build a\ngreat product”.  This means you can go\neither way on much of the rest of it and it doesn’t really matter.  Just make a decision and get back to\nwork.  Product/market fit is what\nmatters.  You can—and will—make a lot of\nmistakes.\n\n25. \nYou make what\nyou measure.\n\n26. \nStartups are\nvery hard no matter what you do; you may as well go after a big opportunity.\n\n27. \nMomentum is\ncritical.  Don’t lose it.\n\n28. \nKeep salaries\nlow and equity high.\n\n29. \nKeep the\norganization as flat as you can.\n\n30. \nWhen working\non a deal—raising money, trying to get a partnership, etc.—it’s important to\ncreate a competitive situation.\n\n31. \nSchleps are\ngood.\n\n32. \nDon’t forget\nto make money.\n\n33. \nJournalists like hearing directly from\nfounders.  If you hire PR people, resist\ntheir desire to control all the contact.\n\n34. \nIt’s standard for founders to keep board control\nin the first round.\n\n35. \nListen to\neveryone.  Then make your own decision.\n\n36. \nRemember that\nyou are more likely to die because you execute badly than get crushed by a\ncompetitor.\n\n37. \nGet lucky.\n\n38. \nHave a direct\nrelationship with your customers.\n\n39. \nBe\nformidable—do not be easy to push around.\n\n40. \nDon’t let your\ncompany be run by a sales guy.  But do learn how to sell your product.\n\n41. \nHave a culture\nthat rewards output.\n\n42. \nDon’t hire\nprofessional managers too early.\n\n43. \nSimple is\ngood.  Be suspicious of complexity.\n\n44. \nGet on planes\nin marginal situations.  In-person is\nstill better than tele-anything.\n\n45. \nMost things\nare not as risky as they seem.\n\n46. \nBe suspect of\nanyone who says the word process too often.\n\n47. \nRaise a bit\nmore money than you think you need.\n\n48. \nIgnore the\nfact that “the press loves [you]”.\n\n49. \nHave great\ncustomer service.\n\n50. \nYou can create value with breakthrough\ninnovation, incremental refinement, or complex coordination.  Great companies often do two of these.  The very best companies do all three.\n\n51. \nThe role of the board is advice and\nconsent.  If the CEO does not lay out a\nclear strategy and tries to get the board to set one, it will usually end in\ndisaster. \n\n52. \nBoard observers are usually a headache.\n\n53. \nIf you pivot, do it fully and with\nconviction.  The worst thing is to try to\ndo a bit of the old and the new—it’s hard to kill your babies.\n\n54. \nIt’s better to make a decision and be wrong than\nto equivocate.\n\n55. \nSet goals for the company and motivate people to\nget there.\n\n56. \nAlways praise good work.\n\n57. \nCelebrate your wins as a company.  Get t-shirts for big milestones.\n\n58. \nHave a good operational cadence where projects\nare short and you’re releasing something new on a regular basis.\n\n59. \nYou can win with the best product, the best\nprice, or the best experience.\n\n60. \nMeetups and conferences are generally a waste of\ntime.\n\n61. \nIf the founders of your company seem to care more about being founders than they care about your specific company, go join another company.\n\n62. \nIt’s easier to sell painkillers than vitamins.\n\n63. \nBe suspicious of any work that is not building\nproduct or getting customers.  It’s easy\nto get sucked into an infrastructure rewrite death spiral.\n\n64. \nIt’s better to have a few users love your\nproduct than for a lot of users to sort of like it.\n\n65. \nLearn how to\nstay extermally optimistic when your world is melting down.\n\n66. \nStartups\nshould require as few miracles as possible, but at least one.\n\n67. \nYou have to\nhave great execution—far more people have good ideas than are willing to roll\nup their sleeves and get shit done.\n\n68. \nDon’t have a\ndiverse culture in the early days.\n\n69. \nKeep a to-do list every day.  At the top of it, put the one or two big\nthings you want to work on.\n\n70. \nBeing the CEO\nis miserable more often than it’s good. \nBut when it’s good, it’s really good.\n\n71. \nOn the really\nbad days, remember that tomorrow will be better—it’s hard to see it being much\nworse!\n\n72. \nSleep and\nexercise.\n\n73. \nSuccess in a\nstartup is usually pass/fail.  Worry more\nabout making sure you pass than an extra point of dilution.\n\n74. \nGood investors are worth a reasonable premium.\n\n75. \nGive your investors something to do.\n\n76. \nGo for a few highly involved investors over a\nlot of lightly engaged ones.\n\n77. \nRaise money on promise.  Raise money on clean terms.\n\n78. \nDo reference checks on your potential\ninvestors.  Ask other founders how they\nare when everything goes wrong.\n\n79. \nInvestors love\ncompanies other investors love.\n\n80. \nA lot of the\nbest ideas seem silly or bad initially—you want an idea at the intersection of\n“seems like bad idea” and “is good idea”. (It’s important to note you need to\nbe contrarian and right, not simply contrarian.)\n\n81. \nSurf someone\nelse’s wave.\n\n82. \nSometimes you can succeed through sheer force of\nwill.\n\n83. \nAll startups\nare fucked in at least one major way. \nKeep going.\n\n84. \nKeep an eye on\ncash in the bank and don’t run out of it.\n\n85. \nPay a lot of\nattention to the relationship between cofounders, especially if both/all of you\nwant to be CEO.\n\n86. \nStay small and\nnimble.\n\n87. \nHave a staff\nmeeting at least once a week.\n\n88. \nFind a mentor that will teach you how to manage.\n\n89. \nKeep burn low until you’re sure everything is\nworking.\n\n90. \nBe suspect about buying users.\n\n91. \nLead by example.\n\n92. \nHave the right kind of office.  The proper office for a very small company is\nan apartment or house.\n\n93. \nShare results (financial and key metrics) with\nthe company every month.\n\n94. \nHave a table\nin your offer letters that shows how much the stock you’re granting a new hire\ncould be worth in various scenarios.\n\n95. \nThe best\nstartups are defined by exceptions; all of these rules are probably breakable,\nbut probably not all at the same time."

And it's tough to keep working when you're really tired, but very often that extra 5% at a critical point is how you beat out a competitor for a critical deal and then they disappear in the rearview mirror.Most startups don't die at the hands of a competitor.  It's more often something like an internal implosion, the founders giving up, or not building something people want (and failing to remedy that situation). You can win by endurance."

        "正文": "TL;DR Without economic growth, democracy doesn’t work because\nvoters occupy a zero-sum system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first piece of startup wisdom I\nheard was “increasing your sales will fix all problems”.   This turns out to be another way of phrasing\nPaul Graham’s point that growth is critical, which is true for all sorts of\nreasons—for example, justifying high valuations to raise large amounts of\ncapital in the early days, attracting the best people and paying them with\nequity, providing a buffer to allow for some mistakes, and smoothing over\ninternal tensions.\n\nI believe that growth is not only\ncritical for startups, but for most systems.   Either you’re growing, or you’re slowly\ndying.  Perfect equilibrium is rare.\n\nOne system that seems to be in\nearly death throes is the United States government.  There’s a lot of political rancor, which is\nparticularly puzzling when one considers that in the 2012 presidential\nelection, Obama and Romney said roughly the same thing.  Dysfunction is high—the sequester, which was\nsupposed to be so unpalatable it would never take effect, actually (and likely\ntemporarily) happened last Friday because the parties couldn’t agree on an\nalternative. There’s a lot of arguing over insignificant issues—enough, in\nfact, to distract us from the fact that no one has new ideas on the big\nissues.  We have trillion dollar deficits\nand no plan to reduce them, and yet the media focus on the sideshows.\n\nA good metric for government\ndysfunction is inability to pass a budget, either leading to a government\nshutdown or a continuing resolution, which lets agencies continue to operate on\nthe previous budget, for a theoretically short time period until we can agree\non a new one.  Passing a budget is a\nfundamental job of Congress and the President.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the US\ngovernment managed to make it about 200 years without any shutdowns.  We had one in 1976, and then a bunch more in\nthe 70s and 80s, plus 3 in the 90s, including one that lasted 21 days.  Shutdowns have fallen out of fashion, and now\nwe just operate with continuing resolutions, and lots of them—for example, 21 for\nthe 2001 budget alone.  The real issue\nwith shutdowns and continuing resolutions is the same—inability to agree on a\nfederal budget.\n\nEvery few months, there’s brief\ndiscussion of some sort of grand bargain, but it always ends in deferral—even\nthe deferrals get deferred!  Everyone\nfeels screwed, and almost no one feels like the government is doing a great\njob.   We can’t agree on anything, and\nanyone that proposes doing something radically different doesn’t get elected.\n\nBut democracy (I’m using democracy\nto include republics and other forms of government where the people get an\neffectively direct say in who the leaders are) worked in the US for a long\ntime—we were able to make real progress, pass budgets, be the world superpower,\nevolve as a country, etc.  Something has\nchanged. \n\nThe US has been blessed with economic\ngrowth for a very long time, first due to natural resources and massive amounts\nof land in which to expand, and then due to a period of technological progress\nrarely matched in human history that lasted approximately until we realized\njust how dangerous nuclear bombs really were and got scared of new technology.  But the frontier is long over, and although\ntechnological innovation has continued at a blistering rate for computers and\nthe Internet, it seems to have slowed down in most other industries.\n\nGrowth may be the root cause of\nAmerican exceptionalism—things consistently got better every decade largely\nbecause we were growing.  People from\nother countries wanted to live here, we led the world in technological\ninnovation, social mobility was high because everyone was getting richer, and\nwe had the resources to get involved around the world.  This is still at least partially true.\n\nBut growth has slowed quite a\nbit.  Here is a graph of real GDP percentage\ngrowth in the United States from 1950 until now, with a trendline.  The trendline goes from just under 5% to just\nunder 2%.  This is a much more\nsignificant drop than it appears, because it compounds exponentially.        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\nA shocking data point about how\nthings are going is that the median real net worth for households headed by\nsomeone under 35 dropped 68% from 1984 to 2009, to $3,662.  For those over 65, it increased 42% to\n$170,494 (largely due to a gain in property values).  This disparity is good evidence of a lack of\nreal growth (and also a very unstable situation where an older generation\nbenefits at the expense of a younger).\n\nHere are two more graphs, the first\nshowing the US unemployment rate (the real numbers are perhaps worse, as people\ndrop out of the work force) and the second showing the US interest rate, both\nof which make a case for slowing growth:        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n                    \n          \n        \n\n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n\n \n\nAll of that said, in absolute sense\nI’d much rather live in the world of today than 1950—it’s tough for me to\nimagine living in a world without the Internet. \nHowever, in the same way that one can feel acceleration but not\nvelocity, people seem more sensitive to the annual rate of improvement than the\nabsolute quality of life.  So even though\npeople should be happier in an absolutely better world, no one wants to stand\nstill on the hedonic treadmill.\n\nMost of us want our lives to get\nbetter every year—the hedonic treadmill is a pain that way.  In a democracy, we theoretically vote for\nwhat we believe will improve our lives the most.  In a system with economic growth, things can\nimprove for everyone.  In a system\nwithout growth, or even one with very little growth, that’s not the case—if\nthings improve for me, it has to come at the expense of things getting worse\nfor you.  Without growth, we’re voting\nagainst someone else’s interest as much as we’re voting for our own.  This ends with lots of fighting and everyone\nfeeling screwed, broken into factions, and unmotivated.  Democracy\ndoes not work well in a zero-sum world. \nAutocratic political systems probably work better with growth too, but\nthe effect of a lack of growth is likely less pronounced right up until the\nrevolution.\n\nSo we need to get growth back,\nunless we want to see this grand experiment end.  Our politicians don’t seem to have any good\nideas about how to do this.  Saying “I\nbelieve in America” and hoping that proof by vigorous assertion starts working\nis not a strategy.\n\nI believe democracy only works in a\nnon-zero-sum world.  We are losing jobs\nthat we will never get back, we are borrowing money and spending it on anything\nbut real investment, and it feels like we are managing a slow decline.  Without growth, we will head towards a\nspecial case of Malthusian dystopia where we have plenty of junk food but not\nenough of anything else.\n\nGrowth is what we should be\nfocusing on.  Growth is great—it lets us\nrun deficits, it means the country is not zero-sum, it lets us invest in\ninnovation and continual improvement in infrastructure, it provides a buffer\nfor a little mismanagement, and it means tomorrow will be better than\ntoday.  Contrary to what one might\nexpect, growth provides long-term stability.\n\nWe must return to real growth,\ngrowth where we do more with less. \nBorrowing money to get ninety growth cents on the dollar does not count,\nalthough that may work for a while.  We have\nto figure out how to fix the real problems with technological innovation—cheaper\nand cleaner energy, better healthcare (15.2% of GDP in 2008 and 18.2% of GDP in\n2011), better transportation, food production, and defense.  GDP growth is probably the only way to fix\nour national debt and entitlement problems, and it’d be better to have real\ngrowth than inflationary growth.\n\nHow to best drive economic growth\nis a difficult question.  It’s easy to\nsay we should just invest in science and technology, and although that’s\nprobably right it’s easier said than done. \nThe government is historically bad at picking winners to invest in, but\nour leaders can perhaps help reverse the cultural shift from pro-science to\nanti-science.  Our current culture has\nshifted to be anti-science; the fear of things like genetically modified food\nand robots is obviously in the way of growth.\n\nWe should strive to make jobs in\nscience and technology more appealing than jobs in finance (incidentally, it\nshould be a big red flag for growth when the brightest young people start going\ninto finance, since they aren’t actually creating any more wealth, just\nredistributing it).  Startups are probably\nthe best way to do this—startups let people that develop a new technology get\nrich, instead of just making GE slightly richer.  So we should encourage startups in whatever\nway we can.\n\nAnother issue is the structure of\nour national budget.  We have, in startup\nparlance, a high burn, and most of it can’t be considered ‘investment’ but is\ninstead ‘expense’.  Spending money on\nthings like infrastructure improvement or new technology that are likely to\ngenerate more money in the future helps growth; spending money on the so-called\nentitlement programs, and parts of the military, does not.  Of course medical care and defense are\nimportant, and we have to have them—this is a tough balancing act.  In some cases, the competitive nature of the\nprivate sector may provide a better path. \nSooner or later, we are going to have an ugly conversation about our\nnational budget—we can delay it for a long time but not forever.  The government, when it needs to spend money\nat all, should aim to invest. \nConsidering what will drive growth is a useful framework for thinking\nabout the best use of resources.\n\nWe should not fear innovation or\nglobalization.  Robots are going to\nreplace human workers in lots of factories; jobs that do require human labor\nare going to continue to move to the lowest-cost place.  But that’s ok, and these sorts of jobs are\nnot what will generate economic growth for us anyway.  We should strive to be a net exporter of\nideas and technologies.  For example, the\nUS makes the best software in the world today. \nIt’d be disastrous for us if that stopped happening.  We should also design the best supersonic jet\nengines, the best nuclear power plants, and the best agricultural technology.\n\nWe should understand that as a\nconsequence of technology and an economy of ideas, the gap between the rich and\nthe poor will likely increase from its already high-seeming levels.  There is good and bad to this, but we should\nbe careful not to legislate against it, which will hurt growth.   Technology magnifies differences in innate\nability; startups provide a framework to get compensated for it.  But GDP growth ought to improve the quality of\nlife for everyone, and no growth will reduce quality of life for everyone\nexcept the very rich.  A safety net for legitimately\npoor people is a good thing, and probably becomes more necessary in a world with\nthis sort of divergence.  Quality of life\nshould improve for everyone; the bigger issue will likely be that people are\nvery sensitive to relative fairness.\n\nPro-growth tax and legal changes\nare a good idea.  As a consequence of a\nhigh burn rate, we have to have high taxes. \nBut other countries don’t have this structural challenge, and so some\nother countries have lower tax rates than we do.  That makes them an appealing place to start a\nbusiness or live.  By reducing our burn\nrate, we can reduce taxes. We don’t need to go crazy here—there are a lot of\nother factors that make the US a very attractive place to start a new\ncompany.  But it would certainly help.  And tax policy should reward activity that\ndrives growth.\n\nThere are some easy legal changes\nwe can make to increase growth. \nImmigration for entrepreneurs and skilled technology workers is an\nobvious one; we should want the best people creating value here, not elsewhere\nin the world.  Tort reform is\nanother—legal protection is of course important, but it’s gotten so silly that\nit discourages innovation.\n\nThere is a lot more we can do.  Most of it is difficult, but growth it is the\ncritical issue.\n\nAs a closing thought, the Airbnb\nfounders used to draw a forward-looking growth graph that they wanted to hit.  It was their number one priority; they put it\nup on their desks, on their refrigerator, and on the mirror in their\nbathroom.  You build what you measure,\nand they built growth.  That seemed to\nwork pretty well for them.\n\nIt’s not as easy if you’re the US\ngovernment.  But probably not impossible,\neither, and it would at least point us in the right direction.\n\n \n\nThanks to Paul Graham, Nick Sivo,\nand Peter Thiel for contributing ideas that led to this blog post."
